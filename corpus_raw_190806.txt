Once in the backyard, she was once like me
She was once like me
Twice when I killed them, they were once at peace
They were once like me
Hold to your gun, man and put off all your peace
Put off all the beats

Paid a full of these
I wait for it, but someone's once like me
She was once like me

I once was better, I put off all my grief
I put off all my grief
And so I go to hell, I wait for it but someone's left me creased
And someone's left me creased

"All The Trees Of The Field Will Clap Their Hands"

If I am alive this time next year
will I have arrived in time to share?
And mine is about as good this far
And I'm still applied to what you are

And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you

And I heard from the trees a great parade
And I heard from the hills a band was made
And will I be invited to the sound?
And will I be a part of what you've made?

And I am throwing all my thoughts away
And I'm destroying every bet I've made
And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you
















































"To Be Alone With You"

I'd swim across Lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

To be alone with me you went up on a tree
I've never known a man who loved me

Abraham

I was the best man in a size too small
You were my best friend, going at it all
And what if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man? All arise us all in peace

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
And I still owe you

Everything rises, going at it all
All the surprises in a size too small
And what if I told you I was still in love with this?
Would you surprise us in a size for all of me?

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
I still know you, the best man
I still owe you









So faithful, so few
So pardon and done
And when we receive
We give a change at last

And when we are dead, we all have wings
We won't need legs to stand
And when we receive
To see a change at last








Our stepmom, we did everything to hate her 
She took us down to the edge of Decatur 
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her 
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator 

Sangamon River, it overflowed 
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator 
Civil War skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator 

The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Stephen A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator 

Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill, and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small caterpillar, go congratulate her

Denominator, go Decatur, go Decatur
It's the great I am 
Abominate her, go Decatur, why did we hate her? 
It's the great I am 
Denominator, go Decatur, anticipate her 
It's the great I am 
Appreciate her, appreciate her
Stand up and thank her

Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
















Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, woah woe is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
I have loved you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video?
I have touched you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video?
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video? Is it a video?
Carrie and Lowell)

Carrie and Lowell
Summertime long ago
Like a dead horse
Meadowlark drive your arrow

Carry me home
Rosie has turned to sorrow
Head on the floorboards
Drunk as a horsefly
Climb on my mattress pad
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree
Shadows and light conspiring
Covered bridge, I scream
Cottage Grove shade invite me

I will bow down
Lord of the ancient waters
In the backyard
Carrie surprised me
Erebus on her back
Like a charm

Suppose the world was not informed by real estate or power lines?
The hidden river of my life, pursued by love
The whispering stone, the valley ford, the candy corn, the spirit finds
Abuse has left me on my side, a single stone

I'm a walker, I'm a dreamer
Treehouse greeter, Pentacostal preacher
I'm a rocker, yeah I'm a schemer
Compost preacher, pioneer believer

A small betrayal, a simple thought to shrug it off, unoccupied
The precious lake, the riverbed, the rising tide
The sad surprise, the day of flags, the flooding fox, the clever chime
Awake my soul, awake my heart and you will find
Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You're not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on Spencer's Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light you look like Poseidon
I'm just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencer's Butte (All of me wants all of you)
Landscape changed my point of view (All of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true (All of me wants all of you)
Now all of me thinks less of you (All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you) [repeat]
Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I’m painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer
I’ve wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

I’m holding mCarrie and Lowell
Such a long time ago
Like a dead horse
Meadowlark drive your arrow

Season of hope (after the flood)
Valentine, spurn my sorrow
Head on the floorboards (covered in blood)
Drunk as a horsefly
Climb on the mattress pad
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree
Shadows and light conspiring
Covered bridge, I scream
Cottage Grove shade invite me

I will bow down (Dido’s lament)
Lord of the ancient waters
From the backyard (as far as she went)
Carrie surprised me
Erebus on my back
My lucky charm
The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain writing the wall
Daniel’s message; blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?
The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply
Light struck from the lemon tree
What if I’d never seen hysterical light from Eugene?
Lemon yoghurt, remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you

Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim, he couldn't quite say my first name
Like a Father he led community water on my head
And he called me “Subaru”
And now I want to be near you
I’m drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?
Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You’re not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used
I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I’m light as a feather
I’m bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief

No, I’m not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe
Spirit of my silence I can hear you, but I'm afraid to be near you
And I don't know where to begin
And I don't know where to begin

Somewhere in the desert there's a forest, and an acre before us
But I don't know where to begin
But I don't know where to begin

Again I lost my strength completely, oh, be near me, tired old mare
With tIt's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets I cover up my face
I do love you
I do love you

And when you play guitar I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
But you are the life I needed all along

If I was a dif-ferent man,
If I had blood in my-ay-ay-ay,eyes -
I could have read of your heart,
I could have read of your eyes -
But now I'm lonely as that,
I put up a fi-i-i-i-ight -
So pick up your battering ram -
Lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it:

[chorus]
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that anyway-eyay-ay

And maybe I talk too fast,
Maybe I talk too-o mu-u-uch -
Give me the sensitive laugh,
Or give me the sensiti-ive to-o-ouch -
Even if I could have kissed,
Even if I couldn't apply,
I'm so sorry I tried lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it -

[chorus]
[words in background during this chorus:]
Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much love
[background, also:] 'love' faintly
Tomorrow you'll see it through
The clouded out disguises put you in the room
And though I wandered out alone
A thousand lights abounded on our home
And I remember every sound it made
The clouded out disguises and the grave
So yeah I know I'm still afraid
Of letting go of choices I have made

All delighted people raise their hands

And I took you by the sleeve
No other reason than to be leading your leading man
And you woke up with a fright
Our lives depended on the visions through the night
All we had always, all we had always wanted to before
The hurricane inclined us, grappling on the floor

All delighted people raise their hands

Still the force of nature spurned
Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement

All delight people raise their hands

I'm not easily confused
The trouble with the storm inside us grew
But I had so much to give
In spite of all the terror and abuse

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make for you and me?

All delighted people raise their hands

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make?
It doesn't matter anyway
The world surrounds us with its hate

Hello darkness my old friend it breaks my heart
I've come to strangle you in spite of what you'd like
And don't be a rascal, don't be a laughing dog in spite of odds
All I'm deciphering from the spirits in the light within

All delighted people raise their hands

In restless dreams I walked alone I walked alive
The clouded out disguises left me in a dream of lightness

All delighted people raise their hands

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And what difference does it make?
I love you so much anyway
And on your breast I gently laid
Your arms surround me in the lake
I am joined with you forever

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make for you and me?

All delighted people raise their hands

I'm not easily confused
I feel alive I feel it glowing in the room

All delighted people raise their hands, all delighted people
All delighted people raise their hands, all delighted people
All delighted people raise their hands, all delighted people
All delighted people raise their hands, all delighted people

And the people bowed and prayed
Oh I love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And what difference does it make?
I still love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And on your breast I gently laid. Oh! My head in your arms
Do you love me from the top of your heart?
I tried my best I tried in vain. Do you love me a lot?
DoThere's nobody better than you
It took me a while till I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?
It just took me a while till I knew

Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
You just grew a little smarter too

So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart
[Verse 1]
If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds
My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

[Pre-Cho[Verse 1]
The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet
A peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that
Lately I've been crying like a tall child

[Chorus]
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't," so I can crawl back in
[Verse 1]
I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM

[Chorus 1]
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
[Verse 1]
Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
Well I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt Happy come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

[Chorus 1]
Oh if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

[Verse 2]
I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well I sighed and mumbled to myself, again I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself
[Verse]
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything

I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem?
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me
[Verse 1]
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
[Verse 1]
I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

[Chorus]
But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
[Verse 1]
We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if
[Verse 1]
I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something
[Verse 1]
Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
[Verse 1]
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
Verse 1]
I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So
[Verse 1]
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live
[Verse 1]
I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show
[Verse 1]
I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

[Chorus]
So if you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
Verse 1]
I love everybody
Because I love you
When you stood up
Walked away, barefoot
And the grass where you lay
Left a bed in your shape
I looked over it
And I ached

[Verse 2]
I love everybody
Because I love you
I don't need the city, and I
Don't need proof
All I need, darling
Is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft
And I ache

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at you, strawberry blond

[Verse 3]
Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her;
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the while lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

[Chorus x2]
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

[Chorus: Backing vocalists]
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my wayVerse 1]

Because I love you

Walked away, barefoot
And the grass where you lay

It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape
Verse 1]
I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

[Hook]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

[Verse 2]
Or at least take my picture
Kuzurete yuku maeni
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

[Hook]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

[Bridge]
How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

[Hook]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture meVerse 1]

About to fall, capture me
Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you

You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
[Verse 3]
Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her;
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the while lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

[Chorus x2]
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

[Chorus: Backing vocalists]
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
[Verse 2]
I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You come down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

[Chorus]
If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for

If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

[Chorus]
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

[Chorus]
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven
[Verse 2]
You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe

[Verse 3]
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye
[Chorus 1]
Why didn't you stop me?
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?

[Verse 2]
I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you

[Chorus 2]
Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over
[Chorus 1]
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"

[Verse 2]
I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right

[Chorus 2]
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?
[Chorus]
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is and it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

[Verse 2]
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

[Chorus]
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out
[Verse 2]
Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say "Hello"
And I lose

[Bridge]
'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

[Verse 3]
In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for

[Chorus]
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?
[Chorus]
You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby

[Verse 2]
I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

[Chorus]
Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
[Verse 2]
And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

[Chorus]
Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better
[Verse 2]
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

[Chorus]
But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

[Chorus]
Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough

[Outro]
But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you
[Chorus 1]
If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

[Chorus 2]
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
[Verse 2]
On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

[Chorus 1]
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

[Chorus 2]
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
[Verse 2]
And I was so young when I behaved twenty five
Yet now I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

[Chorus]
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't," so I can crawl back in

[Outro]
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breatherus]
And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wait for me, I can't come

[Chorus]
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

[Verse 2]
You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

[Chorus]
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you

And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am

And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be?
I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and
Not the way I used to be

'Cause there's nobody better than you.
And the people bowed and prayed
Oh! I love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And you can see through my mistakes
Oh! I'll tell it to you now; Oh! I'll tell it from the top of my heart
When your heirloom's wilted brown
When the devil's pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass
How quickly will your joy pass

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more

So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I'm right?
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time

And what difference does it make
If the world is a mess; if the world is a mess?
And on your breast I gently laid
Oh! I'll tell it to you now; Oh! I'll tell it to you now

When the world's come and gone shall we follow our transgressions
Or shall we stand strong?

I tried to save the things I made
Oh! But the world is a mess, Oh! But the world is a mess
And what difference does it make if the world is a mess?
If the world is a mess!
I tried my best I tried in vain
Oh! But the world is a mess! Oh! But the world is a mess!

Suffer not the child among you or shall you die young
when the world's come and gone
Suffer not the child among you or shall you die young
when the world's come and gone

[chorus again, in the same way as above]

[this is background, at x2 Sufjan comes in with 'There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that' x4]
Na, na na, na, na, na, na [x6]
Meanwhile, another singer is singing:
'La-aaia-a-aaia' [x6]

[music interlude]

[there's background singers singing 'La' over and over in descending keys a few beats before singing, and it continues until a few beats before he ends]
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that word ...

[music interlude]

[this is semi-in the background]
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that.
And when you play guitar I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
But you are the life I needed all along 
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
Words are futile devicesIt's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets I cover up my face
I do love you
I do love you

And when you play guitar I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
But you are the life I needed all along 
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
Words are futile devices
Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well, I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me be my keeper,
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?

I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well, I got nothing to prove
Well, I got nothing to prove

I forgive you, mother, I can hear you,
And I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes, every road leads to an end

Your apparition passes through me in the willows and five red hens
You'll never see us again
You'll never see us again
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don’t back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I’m a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me

Don’t back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Found myself on Spencer’s Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light you look like Poseidon
I’m just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte (All of me wants all of you)
Landscape changed my point of view (All of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true (All of me wants all of you)
Now all of me thinks less of you (All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)
The strength of his arm
My lover caught me off guard
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this now?
How did this happen?
Since I was old enough to speak I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
Where you hid your cigarettes
No I’ll never forget
I just want to be near you

Still I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the start
From the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a mess
Far away the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you

What’s left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind me
Now I’m drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go away
What’s the point of singing songs
If they’ll never even hear you?
Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles

The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now, I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
Carried by stones
Fairyland all around us
Like a dead horse
Sign of your children’s fever

Carrie, come home
(Thorazine’s friend)
Holding your hands with Opai
Like a dead horse
(Shall we ascend)
Flight of the mayfly
Ephemera on my back
She breaks my arm
y breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved my John, so I’ll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost

Drag me to hell
In the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back
In the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling it's fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross

Innocence was never lost
Though it may have been insulted
Even if the Earth forgot
Her inheritance resulted
In contradiction, ceremony
Benediction, hallelujah

There are no more accidents
Living things refuse to offer
Explanations of their worth
We in turn avenge the Author
With paranoia and prediction
Exploration, competition
Ceremony, inner anguish
Consequences, hallelujah

Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don’t you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning

Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life

Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning

Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life

I have loved you for the last time
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
And I have kissed you for the last time
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Visions of Gideon (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon (visions of Gideon)
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Visions of Gideon (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon...
Visions of Gideon (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon...
Is it a video?...
Oh, woah woe is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

Oh, woah woe is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
I'm drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
The father of my last child
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this now?
(What did I do to deserve this now?)
How did this happen?

How did this happen? [x18]
(What did I do)




What the water wants is hurricanes
And sailboats to ride on its back
What the water wants is sun kiss
And land to run into and back

I have a fish stone burning my elbow
Reminding me to know that I'm glad
That I have a bottle filled with my old teeth
They fell out like a tear in the bag

And I have a sister somewhere in Detroit
She has black hair and small hands
And I have a kettledrum
I'll hit the earth with you

And I will crochet you a hat
And I have a red kite
I'll put you right in it
I'll show you the sky
Worth a righteous one
Take up on the wood
Put it on your son

Lake or lamb
There is none to harm
When the angel came
You had raised your arm

Abraham
Put off on your son
Take instead the ram
Until Jesus comes
"In The Devil's Territory"

Be still and know your sign
The beast will arrive in time
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time

To see you
To beat you
To see you
At last

I saw the dragons drying
I saw the witches whine
We stayed a long, long time
But I'm not afraid to die

To see you
To meet you
To see you
At last

I stole my father's shoes
I pulled his pockets too
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time

To see you
To beat you
To see you
To meet you

To see you
At last



"The Dress Looks Nice On You"

I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a lot of bright in you
And I think the dress looks nice on you
I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a bed and make it too
I can see a fireside turn blue
And I can see the lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

When the world looks back
when the face looks after that
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you
I can see your bed and make it too
And I think the dress looks nice on you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I'm drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
The father of my last child
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this now?
(What did I do to deserve this now?)
How did this happen?

How did this happen? [x18]
(What did I do)


It was too hot to make love if you can imagine that except under water and I was never very good at that,” he wrote to Dietrich in a November 1951 note from Cuba, one of 30 letters he wrote her from 1949 to 1959, reflecting their deeply intimate, flirtatious, yet apparently platonic relationship.

“They adored each other, but there was no sexual thing,” said Dietrich’s daughter, Maria Riva. “They were buddies, they were friends, they were comrades in arms.”





Diego.
Truth is, so great, that I wouldn’t like to speak, or sleep, or listen, or love. To feel myself trapped, with no fear of blood, outside time and magic, within your own fear, and your great anguish, and within the very beating of your heart. All this madness, if I asked it of you, I know, in your silence, there would be only confusion. I ask you for violence, in the nonsense, and you, you give me grace, your light and your warmth. I’d like to paint you, but there are no colors, because there are so many, in my confusion, the tangible form of my great love.

F.



Diego:

Nothing compares to your hands, nothing like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. you are the mirror of the night. the violent flash of lightning. the dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. my fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours.



Auxochrome — Chromophore. Diego.

She who wears the color.
He who sees the color.
Since the year 1922.

Until always and forever. Now in 1944. After all the hours lived through. The vectors continue in their original direction. Nothing stops them. With no more knowledge than live emotion. With no other wish than to go on until they meet. Slowly. With great unease, but with the certainty that all is guided by the “golden section.” There is cellular arrangement. There is movement. There is light. All centers are the same. Folly doesn’t exist. We are the same as we were and as we will be. Not counting on idiotic destiny.



My Diego:

Mirror of the night

Your eyes green swords inside my flesh. waves between our hands.

All of you in a space full of sounds — in the shade and in the light. You were called AUXOCHROME the one who captures color. I CHROMOPHORE — the one who gives color.

You are all the combinations of numbers. life. My wish is to understand lines form shades movement. You fulfill and I receive. Your word travels the entirety of space and reaches my cells which are my stars then goes to yours which are my light.




Nordstrom belongs to the last generation of devoted letter writers. She took immense pleasure in the act, often writing to authors when there was no obvious necessity of doing so, except for the all-important necessity of keeping a ‘channel open’ to them. Although she naturally did much of her editorial work with local authors in person or by phone, she also sent long, funny, perceptive letters to those with whom she had just spoken by telephone or just that day met for lunch. Time and again, she simply could not resist the temptation to write.”

Dear Thom:

We had your letter this morning. I will answer it from my point of view and of course Elaine will from hers.

First — if you are in love — that’s a good thing — that’s about the best thing that can happen to anyone. Don’t let anyone make it small or light to you.

Second — There are several kinds of love. One is a selfish, mean, grasping, egotistical thing which uses love for self-importance. This is the ugly and crippling kind. The other is an outpouring of everything good in you — of kindness and consideration and respect — not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable. The first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength, and courage and goodness and even wisdom you didn’t know you had.

You say this is not puppy love. If you feel so deeply — of course it isn’t puppy love.

But I don’t think you were asking me what you feel. You know better than anyone. What you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it — and that I can tell you.

Glory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it.

The object of love is the best and most beautiful. Try to live up to it.

If you love someone — there is no possible harm in saying so — only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness into consideration.

Girls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel, but they usually like to hear it also.

It sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another — but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good.

Lastly, I know your feeling because I have it and I’m glad you have it.

We will be glad to meet Susan. She will be very welcome. But Elaine will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to. She knows about love too and maybe she can give you more help than I can.

And don’t worry about losing. If it is right, it happens — The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.

Love,


She was sitting on the floor in her red velvet jacket & red striped silk shirt, I knotting her pearls into heaps of great clustered eggs. She had come up to see me – so we go on – a spirited, creditable affair, I think, innocent (spiritually) & all gain, I think, rather a bore for Leonard, but not enough to worry him. The truth is one has room for a good many relationships.

Fa
his is the theory… that anything that is art… is presumably about some certain thing, but is really always about something else, and it’s no good having one without the other, because if you just have the something it is boring and if you just have the something else it’s irritating.”
Dear Maurice:

Dearest — my body is simply crazy with wanting you — If you don’t come tomorrow — I don’t see how I can wait for you — I wonder if your body wants mine the way mine wants yours — the kisses — the hotness — the wetness — all melting together — the being held so tight that it hurts — the strangle and the struggle.”

I’ve wanted to write you a note and tell you over the ‘phone that your new ideas for the ending of Kenny’s Window seem wonderful to me, and I’m sure it’s going to be a beautiful book. Keep working on it and when you have all the chapters together, you and I can go over it word for word, and get down to brass tacks, you should forgive the originality of my prose style. But the main thing is: thanks for everything I am sure you are doing to the book. The pages you showed me the other day in the Vanderbilt made me very very very happy.

As for your color pictures for the Krauss book — words are no good whatsoever. There are a few peaks in an editor’s life, and seeing those pictures of yours has been a peak of mine. They are indescribably lovely and absolutely perfect and — well, pure in the best sense.”
Auxochrome — Chromophore

It was the thirst of many years restrained in our body. Chained words which we could not say except on the lips of dreams. Everything was surrounded by the green miracle of the landscape of your body. Upon your form, the lashes of the flowers responded to my touch, the murmur of streams. There was all manner of fruits in the juice of your lips, the blood of the pomegranate, the horizon of the mammee and the purified pineapple. I pressed you against my breast and the prodigy of your form penetrated all my blood through the tips of my fingers. Smell of oak essence, memories of walnut, green breath of ash tree. Horizon and landscapes = I traced them with a kiss. Oblivion of words will form the exact language for understanding the glances of our closed eyes. = You are here, intangible and you are all the universe which I shape into the space of my room. Your absence springs trembling in the ticking of the clock, in the pulse of light; you breathe through the mirror. From you to my hands, I caress your entire body, and I am with you for a minute and I am with myself for a moment. And my blood is the miracle which runs in the vessels of the air from my heart to yours.

The green miracle of the landscape of my body becomes in your the whole of nature. I fly through it to caress the rounded hills with my fingertips, my hands sink into the shadowy valleys in an urge to possess and I’m enveloped in the embrace of gentle branches, green and cool. I penetrate the sex of the whole earth, her heat chars me and my entire body is rubbed by the freshness of the tender leaves. Their dew is the sweat of an ever-new lover.

It’s not love, or tenderness, or affection, it’s life itself, my life, that I found what I saw it in your hands, in your month and in your breasts. I have the taste of almonds from your lips in my mouth. Our worlds have never gone outside. Only one mountain can know the core of another mountain.

Your presence floats for a moment or two as if wrapping my whole being in an anxious wait for the morning. I notice that I’m with you. At that instant still full of sensations, my hands are sunk in oranges, and my body feels surrounded by your arms.



For my Diego

“Since I left you, I have been constantly depressed. My happiness is to be near you. Incessantly I live over in my memory your caresses, your tears, your affectionate solicitude. The charms of the incomparable Josephine kindle continually a burning and a glowing flame in my heart. When, free from all solicitude, all harassing care, shall I be able to pass all my time with you, having only to love you, and to think only of the happiness of so saying, and of proving it to you

A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is

To meet an antique book,

In just the dress his century wore;

A privilege, I think,

His venerable hand to take,

And warming in our own,

A passage back, or two, to make

To times when he was young.

His quaint opinions to inspect,

His knowledge to unfold

On what concerns our mutual mind,

The literature of old;

What interested scholars most,

What competitions ran

When Plato was a certainty.

And Sophocles a man;

When Sappho was a living girl,

And Beatrice wore

The gown that Dante deified.

Facts, centuries before,

He traverses familiar,

As one should come to town

And tell you all your dreams were true;

He lived where dreams were sown.

His presence is enchantment,

You beg him not to go;

Old volumes shake their vellum heads

And tantalize, just so.


SUCCESS.

[Published in "A Masque of Poets" at the request of "H.H.," the author's fellow-townswoman and friend.]

Success is counted sweetest

By those who ne'er succeed.

To comprehend a nectar

Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple host

Who took the flag to-day

Can tell the definition,

So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying,

On whose forbidden ear

The distant strains of triumph

Break, agonized and clear!



All trials are trials for one’s life, just as all sentences are sentences of death, and three times I have been tried. The first time I left the box to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of detention, and the third time to pass into prison for two years. Society as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer; but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on just and unjust alike, will have clefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence I may weep undisturbed. She will hang with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole



Your letter from Trieste came this morning—But why do you think I don’t feel, or that I make phrases? ‘Lovely phrases’ you say which rob things of reality. Just the opposite. Always, always, always I try to say what I feel. Will you then believe that after you went last Tuesday—exactly a week ago—out I went into the slums of Bloomsbury, to find a barrel organ. But it did not make me cheerful … And ever since, nothing important has happened—Somehow its dull and damp. I have been dull; I have missed you. I do miss you. I shall miss you. And if you don’t believe it, you’re a longeared owl and ass. Lovely phrases? …

But of course (to return to your letter) I always knew about your standoffishness. Only I said to myself, I insist upon kindness. With this aim in view, I came to Long Barn. Open the top button of your jersey and you will see, nestling inside, a lively squirrel with the most inquisitive habits, but a dear creature all the same—




I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia. I composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night, and it has all gone: I just miss you, in a quite simple desperate human way. You, with all your un-dumb letters, would never write so elementary phrase as that; perhaps you wouldn’t even feel it. And yet I believe you’ll be sensible of a little gap. But you’d clothe it in so exquisite a phrase that it would lose a little of its reality. Whereas with me it is quite stark: I miss you even more than I could have believed; and I was prepared to miss you a good deal. So this letter is just really a squeal of pain. It is incredible how essential to me you have become. I suppose you are accustomed to people saying these things. Damn you, spoilt creature; I shan’t make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this—But oh my dear, I can’t be clever and stand-offish with you: I love you too much for that. Too truly. You have no idea how stand-offish I can be with people I don’t love. I have brought it to a fine art. But you have broken down my defences. And I don’t really resent it …

 375 

Was Santiago doomed. Ilis cliancc had come; 

 swooped upon it, plundered it, and was gone, 

Leaving the treacherous isle a desolate heap 

Of smoking ashes in the leaden sea, 

While onward all those pirate bowsprits plunged 

Into the golden West, across the broad 

Atlantic once again; ''I'or I will show," 

Said Drake, "that Englishmen henceforth will sail 

Old ocean where thej^ will." Onward they surged, 

And the great glittering crested majestic waves 

Jul)ilantly rushed up to meet the keels, 

And there was nought around them but the gicy 

Ruin and roar of the huge Atlantic seas, 

Grey mounded seas, pursuing and pursued, 

That fl}', hounded and hounding on for ever, 

From empty marge to marge of the grey sky. 

Over the wandering wilderness of foam. 

Onward, through storm and death,  swept; for no^\' 

Once more a fell plague gripped the tossing ships, 

And not by twos and threes as heretofore 

His crews were minished; but in three black days 

Three hundred seamen in their shotted shrouds 

Were cast into the deep. Onward he swept, 

Implacably^ having in mind to strike 

Spain in the throat at St. Domingo, port 

Of Hispaniola, a city of far renown, 

A jewel on the shores of old romance, 

Palm-shadowed, gated with immortal gold, 

Queen city of Spain's dominions over sea, 

And guarded by great guns. Out of the da^vn 

The pirate ships came leaping, grim and black, 

And ere the Spaniards were awake, the flag 

Of England floated from their topmost tower. 

But since he had not troops enough to hold 

So great a city,  entrenched his men 

Within the Plaza and held the batteries. 

Thence he demanded ransom, and sent out 

A boy with flag of truce. The boy's return 

 waited long. Under a sheltering palm 

He stood, watching the enemies' camp, and lo, 

Along the hot white purple-shadowed road 



376  

ToVrds him, a crawling shape writhed through the dust 

Up to his feet, a shape besmeared with blood, 

A shape that held the stumps up of its wrists 

And moaned, an eyeless thing, a naked rag 

Of flesh obscenely mangled, a small face 

Hideously puckered, shrivelled like a monkey's 

With lips drawn backward from its teeth. 

"Speak, speak. 
In God's name, speak, what art thou?" whispered Drake, 
And a sharp cry came, answering his dread, 
A cry as of a sea-bird in the wind 
Desolately astray from all earth's shores, 
"Captain, I am thy boy, only thy boy! 
See, see, my captain, see what they have done! 
Captain, I only bore the flag; I only " 



"0, lad, lad, lad," moaned Drake, and, stooping, strove 
To pillow the mangled head upon his arm. 
" What have they done to thee, what have they done?" 
And at the touch the boy screamed, once, and died. 



Then like a savage sea with arms uplift 

To heaven the wrath of  blazed thundermg, 

"Eternal God, be this the doom of Spain! 

Henceforward have no pity. Send the strength 

Of Thy great seas into my soul that I 

May devastate this empire, this red hell 

They make of Thy good earth." 

His men drew round. 
Staring in horror at the silent shape 
That daubed his feet. Like a cold wind 
His words went through their flesh: 

"This is the M 
That bore our flag of truce. This hath Spain done. 
Look well upon it, draw the smoke of the blood 
Up into your nostrils, my companions, 
And down into your souls. This makes an end 
For Spain ! Bring forth the Spanish prisoners 
And let me look on them." 



 377 

Forth they were brought, 
A swarthy gorgeous band of soldiers, priests, 
And sailors, hedged between tv/o sturdy files 
Of British tars vsith naked cutlasses. 
Close up to  they halted, under the palm, 
Gay smiling prisoners, for they thought their friends 
Had ransomed them. Then they looked up and met 
A glance that swept athwart them like a sword, 
Making the blood strain back from their blanched faces 
Into their quivering hearts, with unknown dread, 
As that accuser pointed to the shape 
Before his feet. 

" Dogs, will ye lap his blood 
Before ye die? Make haste; for it grou-s cold! 
Ye will not, will not even dabble your hands 
In that red puddle of flesh, what? Are ye Spaniards? 
Come, come, I'll look at you, perchance there's one 
That's but a demi-devil and holds you back." 
And with the word  stepped among their ranks 
And read each face among the swarthy crew — 
The gorgeous soldiers, ringleted sailors, priests 
With rosary and cross, a slender page 
In scarlet vrith a cloud of golden hair, 
And two rope-girdled friars. 

The slim page 
 drew before the throng. ''You are young," he said, 
"Go; take this message to the camp of Spain: 
Tell them I have a hunger in my soul 
To look upon the murderers of this boy. 
To see what eyes they have, what manner of mouths. 
To touch them and to take their hands in mine, 
And draw them close to me and smUe upon them 
Until they know my soul as I know theirs, 
And they grovel in the dust and grope for mercy. 
Say that, until I get them, every day 
I'll hang two Spaniards though I dispeople 
The Spanish Main. Tell them that, every day, 
I'll bum a portion of their city down, 
Then find another city and burn that. 
And then bum others till I burn away 
Their empire from the world, ay, till I reach 



378  

The imperial throne of Philip with my fires, 
And send it shrieking down to burn in hell 
For ever. Go!" 

Then  turned once again 
To face the Spanish prisoners. With a voice 
Cold as the passionless utterance of Fate 
His grim command went forth. "Now, provost-marshal, 
Begin with yon two friars, in whose faces 
Chined like singed swine, and eyed with the spent coals 
Of filthy living, sweats the glory of Spain. 
Strip off their leprous rags 

And twist their ropes around their throats and hang them 
High over the Spanish camp for all to see. 
At dawn I'll choose two more." 



BOOK X 



Across the Atlantic 
Great rumours rushed as of a mighty wind. 
The wind of the spirit of Drake. But who shall tell 
In this cold age the power that he became 
Who drew the universe within his soul 
And moved with cosmic forces? Though the deep 
Divided it from Drake, the gorgeous court 
Of Philip shuddered away from the streaming coasts 
As a wind-cuffed field of golden wheat. The King, 
Bidding his guests to a feast in his own ship 
On that wind-darkened sea, was made a mock, 
As one by one his ladies proffered excuse 
For fear of That beyond. Round Europe now 
Ballad and story told how in the cabin 
Of Francis  there hung a magic glass 
Wherein he saw the fleets of every foe 
And all that passed aboard them. Rome herself, 
Perplexed that this proud heretic should prevail. 
Fostered a darker dream, that  had bought, 
Like old Norse wizards, power to loose or bind 
The winds at will. 



 379 

And now a wilder tale 
Flaslicd o'er the deep — of a distant blood-red dawn 
O'er San Domingo, where the embattled troops 
Of Spain and  were met — but not in war- 
Met in the dawn, by his compelling will, 
To offer up a sacrifice. Yea, there 
Between the hosts, the hands of S{)ain herself 
Slaughtered the Spanish murderers of the boy 
Who had borne Drake's flag of truce; offered them up 
As a blood-oft'ering and an expiation 
Lest Drake, with that dread alchemy of his soul, 
Should e'en transmute the dust beneath their feet 
To one same substance with the ])lace of pain 
And whelm them suddenl}' in the eternal fires. 
Rumour on rumour rushed across the sea, 
Large mockeries, and one most bitter of all, 
Wormwood to Philip, of how  had stood 
r the governor's house at San Domingo, and seen 
A mighty scutcheon of the King of Spain 
Whereon was pamted the terrestrial globe, 
And on the globe a mighty steed in act 
To spring into the heavens, and from its mouth 
Streaming like smoke a scroll, and on the scroll 
Three words of flame and fury — Xo7i sufficit 
Orbis — of how  and his seamen stood 
Gazing upon it, and could not forbear 
From summoning the Spaniards to expound 
Its meaning, whereupon a hurricane roar 
Of mirth burst from those bearded British lips, 
And that inmiortal laughter shook the world. 



So, while the imperial warrior eyes of Sj)ain 
Watched, every hour, her vast Armada grow 
Readier to launch and shatter with one stroke 
Our island's frail defence, fear gripped her still, 
For there came sounds across the heaving sea 
Of secret springs unsealed, forces unchained, 
A mustering of deep elemental powers, 
A sound as of the burgeoning of boughs 
In universal April and dead hearts 



380  

Uprising from their tombs; a mighty cry 

Of resurrection, surging through the souls 

Of all mxanldnd. For now the last wild tale 

Swept like another dawn across the deep; 

And, in that dawn, men saw the slaves of Spain, 

The mutilated negroes of the mines. 

With gaunt backs wealed and branded, scarred and seared 

By whip and iron, in Spain's brute lust for gold, 

Saw them, at Drake's great liberating word, 

Burst from their chains, erect, uplifting hands 

Of rapture to the glad new light that then, 

Then first, began to struggle thro' the clouds 

And crown all manhood with a sacred crown 

August — a light which, though from age to age 

Clouds may obscure it, grows and still shall grow. 

Until that Kingdom come, that grand Communion, 

That Commonweal, that Empire, which still draws 

Nigher with every hour, that Federation, 

That turning of the wasteful strength of war 

To accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace, 

That gathering up of one another's loads 

Whereby the weak are strengthened and the strong 

Made stronger in the increasing good of all. 

Then, suddenly, it seemed, as he had gone, 

A ship came stealing into Plymouth Sound 

And  was home again, but not to rest; 

For scarce had he cast anchor ere the road 

To London rang beneath the flying hoofs 

That bore his brief despatch to Burleigh, saying — 

"We have missed the Plate Fleet by but twelve hours' sail, 

The reason being best known to God. No less 

We have given a cooling to the King of Spain. 

There is a great gap opened which, methinks, 

Is little to his liking. We have sacked 

The towns of his chief Indies, burnt their ships. 

Captured great store of gold and precious stones, 

Three hundred pieces of artillery. 

The more part brass. Our loss is heavy indeed. 

Under the hand of God, eight hundred men. 

Three parts of them by sickness. Captain Moone. 

My trusty old companion, he that struck 



 381 

The first blow in the South Seas cat a Spaniard, 

Died of a grievous wound at Cartagena. 

^ly fleet and I are ready to strike again 

At once, where'er the Queen and England please. 

I pray for her commands, and those \\ith speed, 

That I may strike again." Outside the scroll 

These words were writ once more — "My Queen's commands 

I much desire, your servant, Francis Drake." 

This terse despatch the hunchback Burleigh read 
Thrice over, with the broad cliff of his brow 
Bending among his l)ooks. Thrice he assayed 
To steel himself with caution as of old; 
And thrice, as a glorious lightning running along 
And flashing between those simple words, he saw 
The great new power that lay at England's hand, 
An ocean-sovereignty, a power unknown 
Before, but dawning now; a power that swept 
All earth's old plots and counterplots away 
Like straws; the germ of an unmeasured force 
New-born, that laid the source of Spanish might 
At England's mercy! Could that force but grow 
Ere Spain should nip it, ere the mighty host 
That waited in the Xetherlands even now, 
That host of thirty thousand men encamped 
Round Antwerp, under Parma, should embark 
Convoyed by that Invincible Armada 
To leap at England's throat! Thrice he assayed 
To think of England's helplessness, her ships 
Little and few. Thrice he assaj-ed to quench 
With caution the high furnace of his soul 
Which  had kindled. As he read tlie last 
Rough simple plea, I wait my Queen^s commands, 
His deep eyes flashed with glorious tears. 

lie leapt 
To his feet and cried aloud, "Before my God, 
I am proud, I am very proud for England's sake! 
This  is a teriiblc man to the King of Spain." 

And still, still, Gloriana, brooding darkl}'

"Tore God," 
Cried Walsingham, *'my Queen, 3-0U do them \\Tong! 
There is another Rome — not this of Spain 
Which lurks to pluck the world back into darkness 
And stab it there for gold. There is a City 
T\Tiose eyes are tow'rd the morning; on whose heights 
Blazes the Cross of Chxrist above the world; 
A Rome that shall wage warfare yet for God 
In the dark days to come, a Rome whose thought 
Shall march with our humanity and be proud 
To cast old creeds like seed into the ground, 
Watch the strange shoots and foster the new flower 
Of faiths we know not j'et. Is this a di'eam? 
I speak as one by knighthood bound to speak; 
For even this day — and my heart burns with it — 
I heard the Catholic gentlemen of England 
Speaking in grave assembly. At one breath 
Of peril to our island, why, their swords 
Leapt from their scabbards, and their crj^ went up 
To split the heavens — God save our English Queen! " 
Even as he spake there passed the rushing gleam 
Of torches once again, and as they stood 
Silently listening, all the winds ran wild 
With clamouring bells, and a great cry went up — 
God save Elizabeth, our English Queen! 

"I'll vouch for some two hundred Catholic throats 

Among that thousand," whispered Walsingham 

Eagerly, with his eyes on the Queen's face. 

Then, seeing it brighten, fer^-ently he cried. 

Pressing the swift advantage home, "O, Madam, 

The heart of England now is all on fire! 

We are one people, as we have not been 

In all our history, all prepared to die 

Around your throne. !Madam, you are beloved 

As never yet was English king or queen!"' 

She looked at him, the tears in her keen eyes 

Glittered — "And I am very proud," she said, 

"But if our enemies command the world, 

And we have one small island and no more ..." 

She ceased; and Drake, in a strange voice, hoarse and low. 



 385 

Trcmbliiig with passion deeper than all speech, 
Crietl out — "No more than the great ocean-sea 
Which makes the enemies' coast our frontier now; 
No more than that great Empire of the deep 
Whicli rolls from Pole to Pole, washing the world 
With thunder, that great Empire whose command 
This da}' is yours to take. Hear me, my Queen, 
This is a dream, a new dream, but a true; 
For mightier days are dawning on the world 
Than heart of man hath known. If England hold 
The sea, she holds the hundred thousand gates 
That open to futurity. She holds 
The higliway of all ages. Argosies 
Of unknown glory set their sails this day 
For England out of ports beyond the stars. 
Ay, on the sacred seas we ne'er shall know 
They hoist their sails this day by peaceful quays, 
Great gleaming whan-es in the perfect Cityof God, 
If she but clahn her heritage." 

He ceased; 
And the deep dream of that new realm the sea, 
Through all the soul of Gloriana surged, 
A moment, then with splendid eyes that filled 
With fire of sunsets far awaj', she cried 
(Faith making her a child, yet quecnlier still) 
"Yea, claim it tliou for me!" 

A moment there 
Trembling she stood. Then, once again, there passed 
A ru.sh of torches through the gloom without, 
And a great cry ''God save Elizabeth, 
God save our English Queen!" 

"Yea go, then, go, " 
She said, "God speed you now, Sir Francis Drake, 
Not as a privateer, but with full powers. 
My Admiral-at-the-Seas!" 

Without a word 
 bent above her hand and, ere she knew it, 
His eyes from the dark doorwaj- flashed farewell 
And he was gone. But ere he leapt to saddle 
Walsingham stood at his stirrup, muttering "Ride, 
Ride now like hell to Plymouth; for the Queen 

25 



386  

Is hard beset, and ere ye are out at sea 
Her mood will change. The friends of Spain will move 
Earth and the heavens for your recall. They'll tempt her 
With their false baits of peace, though I shall starid 
Here at your back through thick and thin; farewell!" 
Fire flashed beneath the hoofs and  was gone. 

Scarce had he vanished in the night than doubt 

Once more assailed the Queen. The death of Mary 

Had brought e'en France against her. Walsingham, 

And Burleigh himself, prime mover of that death, 

Being held in much disfavour for it, stood 

As helpless. Long ere  or human power, 

They thought, could put to sea, a courier sped 

To Plymouth bidding  forbear to strike 

At Spain, but keep to the high seas, and lo. 

The roadstead glittered empty.  was gone! 

Gone! Though the friends of Spain had poured their gold 

To thin his ranks, and every hour his crews 

Deserted, he had laughed — "Let Spain buy scum! 

Next to an honest seaman I love best 

An honest landsman. What more goodly task 

Than teaching brave men seamanship?" He had filled 

His ships with soldiers! Out in the teeth of the gale 

That raged against him he had driven. In vain, 

Amid the boisterous laughter of the quays, 

A pinnace dashed in hot pursuit and met 

A roaring breaker and came hurthng back 

With oars and spars all trailing in the foam, 

A tangled mass of wreckage and despair. 

Sky swept to stormy sky: no sail could live 

In that great yeast of waves; but  was gone! 

Then, once again, across the rolling sea 

Great rumours rushed of how he had sacked the port 

Of Cadiz and had swept along the coast 

To Lisbon, where the whole Armada lay. 

Had snapped up prizes under its very nose, 

And taunted Santa Cruz, High Admiral 

Of Spain, striving to draw him out for fight. 

And offering, if his course should lie that way, 



 387 

To convoy liim to Britain, taunted him 

So bitterly that for once, in the worhl's eyes, 

A jest had power to kill; for Santa Cruz 

Died with the spleen of it, since he could not move 

Before the appointed season. Then there came 

Flying back home, the Queen's old Admiral 

Borough, deserting  and all aghast 

At Drake's temerity: "For," he said, "this man. 

Thrust o'er my head, against all precedenl. 

Bade me follow him into harbour mouths 

A-flame with cannon like the jaws of death, 

Whereat I much demurred; and straightway  

Clapped me in irons, me — an officer 

And Admiral of the Queen; and, though my voice 

Was all against it, plunged into the pit 

Without me, left me with some word that burns 

And ranldes in me still, making me fear 

The man was mad, some word of lonely seas, 

A desert island and a mutineer 

And dead jNIagellan's gallows. Sirs, my life 

Was hardly safe with him. Why, he resolved 

To storm the Castle of St. Vincent, sirs, 

A castle on a cliff, grinning with guns, 

Well known impregnable! The Spaniards fear 

Drake; but to see him land below it and bid 

Surrender, sirs, the strongest fort of Spain 

Without a blow, they laughed! And straightvray he, 

With all the fury of Satan, turned that cliff 

To hell itself. He sent down to the ships 

For faggots, broken oars, beams, bowsprits, masts. 

And piled them up against the outer gates. 

Higher and higher, and fired them. There he stood 

Amid the smoke and flame and cannon-shot. 

This Admiral, like a common seamen, black 

With soot, besmeared with blood, his naked arms 

Full of great faggots, labouring like a giant 

And roaring like Apollyon. Sirs, he is mad! 

But did he take it, say you? Yea, he took it, 

The mightiest stronghold on the coast of Spain, 

Took it and tumbled all its big brass guns 

Clattering over the cliffs into the sea. 



388  

But, sirs, ye need not raise a cheer so loud! 
It is not warfare. 'Twas a madman's trick, 
A devil's!" 

Then the rumour of a storm 
That scattered the fleet of  to the four winds 
Disturbed the heart of England, as his ships 
Came straggling into harbour, one by one, 
Saying they could not find him. Then, at last, 
When the storm burst in its earth-shaking might 
Along our coasts, one night of rolling gloom 
His cannon woke old Plymouth. In he came 
Across the thunder and lightning of the sea 
With his grim ship of war and, close behind, 
A shadow like a mountain or a cloud 
Torn from the heaven-high panoplies of Spain, 
A captured galleon loomed, and round her prow 
A blazoned scroll, whence (as she neared the quays 
Which many a lanthorn swung from brawny fist 
Yellowed) the sudden crimson of her name 
San Filippe flashed o'er the white sea of faces. 
And a rending shout went skyward that outroared 
The blanching breakers — '' 'Tis the heart of Spain! 
The great San Filippe!^' Overhead she towered, 
The mightiest ship afloat; and in her hold 
The riches of a continent, a prize 
Greater than earth had ever known; for there 
Not only ruby and pearl like ocean-beaches 
Heaped on some wizard coast in that dim hull 
Blazed to the lanthorn-light; not only gold 
Gleamed, though of gold a million would not buy 
Her store; but in her cabin lay the charts 
And secrets of the wild unwhispered wealth 
Of India, secrets that splashed London wharves 
With coloured dreams and made her misty streets 
Flame like an Eastern City when the sun 
Shatters itself on jev/elled domes and spills 
Its crimson wreclcage thro' the silvery palms. 
And of those dreams the far East India quest 
Began : the first foundation-stone was laid 
Of our great Indian Empire, and a star 
Began to tremble on the brows of England 
That time can never darken. 



 389 

But now the seas 
Darkened indeed with menace; now at hist 
The cohl wind of the black approaching wings 
Of Azrael crept across tiie deep: the storm 
Throbbed witii their thunderous pulse, and ere that moon 
Waned, a swift gunboat foamed into the Sound 
With word that all the Invincible Armada 
Was hoisting sail for England. 

Even now, 
Elizabeth, torn a thousand waj's, withheld 
The word for which  pleatled as for life, 
That he might meet them ere they left their coasts, 
Meet them or ever they reached the Channel, meet them 
Now, or — "Too late! Too late!" At last his voice 
Beat do\Mi e'en those that blindly dinned her ears 
Vv'ith chatter of meeting S])ain on British soil; 
And swiftly she commanded (seeing once more 
The light that burned amid the approaching gloom 
In Drake's deep eyes) Lord Howard of Efiingham, 
High Admiral of England, straight to join him 
At Plymouth Sound. "Plow many ships are wanted?" 
She asked him, thinking "we are few, indeed!" 
"Give me but sixteen merchantmen," he said, 
"And but four battleships, by the mercy of God, 
ril answer for the Armada!" Out to sea 
They swept, in the teeth of a gale; but vainly  
Strove to impart the thought wherewith his mind 
Travailed — to win command of the ocean-sea 
By bursting on the fleets of Spain at once 
Even as they left their ports, not as of old 
To hover in a vain dream of defence 
Round fifty threatened points of British coast, 
But Howard, clinging to his old-world order. 
Flung out his ships in a loose, long, straggling line 
Across the Channel, waiting, wary, alert. 
But powerless thus as a string of scattered sea-gulls 
Beating against the storm. Then, flying to meet them, 
A merchantman brought terror down the wind, 
With news that she had seen that monstrous host 
Stretching from sky to sky, great hulks of doom, 
Dragging death's midnight with them o'er the sea 



390  

Tow'rds England. Up to Howard's flag-ship  
In his immortal battle-ship — Revenge, 
Rushed thro' the foam, and thro' the swirling seas 
His pinnace dashed alongside. On to the decks 
0' the tossing flag-ship, like a very Viking 
Shaking the surf and rainbows of the spray 
From sun-smit lion-like mane and beard he stood 
Before Lord Howard in the escutcheoned poop 
And poured his heart out like the rending sea 
In passionate wave on wave : 

" If yonder fleet 
Once reach the Channel, hardly the mercy of God 
Saves England! I would pray with my last breath, 
Let us beat up to windward of them now. 
And handle them before they reach the Channel." 
''Nay; but we cannot bare the coast," cried Howard, 
"Nor have we stores of powder or food enough!" 
"My lord," said Drake, with his great arm outstretched, 
"There is food enough in yonder enemy's ships. 
And powder enough and cannon-shot enough! 
We must re- victual there. Look! look!" he cried, 
And pointed to the heavens. As for a soul 
That by sheer force of will compels the world 
To work his bidding, so it seemed the wind 
That blew against them slowly veered. The sails 
Quivered, the skies revolved. A northerly breeze 
Awoke and now, behind the British ships. 
Blew steadily tow'rds the unseen host of Spain. 
"It is the breath of God," cried Drake; "they lie 
Wind-bound, and we may work our will with them. 
Signal the word. Lord Howard, and drive down!" 
And as a man convinced by heaven itself 
Lord Howard ordered, straightway, the whole fleet 
To advance. 

And now, indeed, as  foresaw, 
The Armada lay, beyond the dim horizon. 
Wind-bound and helpless in Corunna bay. 
At England's mercy, could her fleet but draw 
Nigh enough, with its fire-ships and great guns 
To windward. Nearer, nearer, league by league 
The ships of England came; till Ushant lay 



 391 

Some seventy leagues beliind. Then, yet once more 
The wind veered, straight against them. To remain 
Beating against it idly was to starve: 
And, as a man wliose jiowcr upon the world 
Fails for one moment of exhausted will, 
Drake, gathering up his forces as he went 
For one more supreme effort, turned his ship 
Tow'rds Plymouth, and retreated with the rest. 

There, while the ships refitted with all haste 

And axe and hammer rang, one golden eve 

Just as the setting sun began to fringe 

The clouds with crimson, and the creaming waves 

Were one wild riot of fair}' rainbows,  

Stood \\-ith old comrades on the close-cropped green 

Of Plymouth Hoe, playing a game of bowls. 

Far off unseen, a little barque, full-sail, 

Struggled and leapt and strove tow'rds Plymouth Sound, 

Noteless as any speckled herring-gull 

Flickering between the white flakes of the waves. 

A group of schoolboj's wdth their satchels lay 

Stretched on the green, gazing with great \^dde eyes 

Upon their seamen heroes, as like gods 

Disporting with the battles of the world 

They loomed, tossing black bowls like cannon-balls 

Against the rosy West, or lounged at ease 

W^ith faces olive-dark against that sky 

Laughing, while from the neighboring inn mine host, 

White aproned and blue-jerkined, hurried out 

With foaming cups of sack, and they drank deep, 

Tossing their heads back under the golden clouds 

And burying their bearded lips. The hues 

That slashed their doublets, for the boy's bright eyes 

(Even as the gleams of Grecian cloud or moon 

Revealed the old gods) were here rich dusky streaks 

Of splendour from the Spanish Main, that shone 

But to proclaim these heroes. There a boy 

More bold crept nearer to a slouched hat thrown 

Upon the green, and touched the silver plume, 

And felt as if he had touched a sunset-isle 

Of feathery palms beyond a crimson sea. 



392  

Another stared at the blue rings of smoke 

A storm-scarred seaman puffed from a long pipe 

Primed with the strange new herb they had lately found 

In far Virginia. But the little ship 

Now plunging into Plymouth Bay none saw. 

E'en when she had anchored and her straining boat 

Had touched the land, and the boat's crew over the quays 

Leapt with a shout, scarce was there one to heed. 

A seaman, smiling, swaggered out of the inn 

Swinging in one brown hand a gleaming cage 

Wherein a big green parrot chattered and clung 

Fluttering against the wires. A troop of girls 

With arms linked paused to watch the game of bowls; 

And now they flocked around the cage, while one 

With rosy finger tempted the horny beak 

To bite. Close overhead a sea-mew flashed 

Seaward. Once, from an open window, soft 

Through trellised leaves, not far away, a voice 

Floated, a voice that flushed the cheek of Drake, 

The voice of Bess, bending her glossy head 

Over the broidery frame, in a quiet song. 

The song ceased. Still, with rainbows in their eyes, 
The schoolboys watched the bowls like cannon-balls 
Roll from the hand of gods along the turf. 

Suddenly, tow'rds the green, a little cloud 

Of seamen, shouting, stumbling, as they ran 

Drew all eyes on them. The game ceased. A voice 

Rough with the storms of many an ocean roared 

''Drake! Cap'en Drake! The Armada! 

They are in the Channel! We sighted them — 

A line of battleships! We could not see 

An end of them. They stretch from north to south 

Like a great storm of clouds, glinting with guns, 

From sky to sky!" 

So, after all his strife. 
The wasted weeks had tripped him, the fierce hours 
Of pleading for the sea's command, great hours 
And golden moments, all were lost. The fleet 
Of Spain had won the Channel without a blow. 



 303 

All eyes were turned on Dralce, as he stood there 
A giant against the sunset and the sea 
Looming, alone. Far off, the first white star 
Gleamed in a rosy space of heaven. He tossed 
A grim black ball i' the lustrous air and laughed, — 
"Come, lads," he said, "we've time to finish the game " 



BOOK XI 

Few minutes, and well wasted those, were spent 
On that great game of bowls; for well knew  
What panic threatened Plymouth, since his fleet 
Lay trapped there by the black head-wind that blew 
Straight up the Sound, and Plymouth town itself, 
Except the ships won seaward ere the dawn, 
Lay at the Armada's mercy. Never a seaman 
Of all the sea-dogs clustered on the quays, 
And all the captains clamouring round Lord Howard, 
Hoped that one ship might win to the open sea: 
At dawn, they thought, the Armada's rolling guns 
To windward, in an hour, must shatter them, 
Huddled in their red slaughter-house like sheep. 

Now was the great sun sunken and the night 

Dark. Far to Westward, like the soul of man 

Fighting blind nature, a ^\^ld flare of red 

Upon some windy headland suddenly leapt 

And vanished flickering into the clouds. Again 

It leapt and vanished: then all at once it streamed 

Steadily as a crimson torch upheld 

By Titan hands to heaven. It was the first 

Beacon! A sudden silence swept along 

The seething quays, and in their midst appeared 

Drake. 

Then the jubilant thunder of his voice 
Rolled, bufTcting the sca-A\'ind far and nigh. 
And ere they knew what power as of a sea . 
Surged through them, his immortal battle-ship 
Revenge had flung out cables to the quays. 



394  

And while the seamen, as he had commanded, 

Knotted thick ropes together, he stood apart 

(For well he knew what panic threatened still) 

Whittling idly at a scrap of wood, 

And carved a little boat out for the child 

Of some old sea-companion. 

So great and calm a master of the world 

Seemed  that, as he whittled, and the chips 

Fluttered into the blackness over the quay. 

Men said that in this hour of England's need 

Each tiny flake turned to a battle-ship; 

For now began the lanthorns, one by one. 

To glitter, and half -reveal the shadowy hulks 

Before him. — So the huge old legend grew, 

Not all unworthy the Homeric age 

Of gods and god-like men. 

St. Michael's Mount, 
Answering the first wild beacon far away. 
Rolled crimson thunders to the stormy sky! 
The ropes were knotted. Through the panting dark 
Great heaving lines of seamen all together 
Hauled with a shout, and all together again 
Hauled with a shout against the roaring wind; 
And slowly, slowly, onward tow'rds the sea 
Moved the Revenge, and seaward ever heaved 
The brawny backs together, and in their midst. 
Suddenly, as they slackened,  was there 
Hauling like any ten, and with his heart 
Doubling the strength of all, giving them joy 
Of battle against those odds, — ay, till they found 
Delight in the burning tingle of the blood 
That even their hardy hands must feel besmear 
The harsh, rough, straining ropes. There as they toiled, 
Answering a score of hills, old Beachy Head 
Streamed like a furnace to the rolling clouds 
Then all around the coast each windy ness 
And craggy mountain kindled. Peak from peak 
Caught the tremendous fire, and passed it on 
Round the bluff East and the black mouth of Thames, — 
Up, northward to the waste wild Yorkshire fells 
And gloomy Cumberland, where, like a giant. 



 39o 

Great Skiddaw grasped Uie red lenipestuous brand, 

And thrust it up against the reeling heavens. 

Then all night long, inland, the wandering winds 

Ran wild with elaniour and clash of startled bells; 

All night the cities seethed with torches, flashed 

With twent}' thousand flames of burnished steel; 

While over the tramj)le and thunder of hooves blazed forth 

The lightning of wild trumpets. Lonely lanes 

Of country darkness, lit by cottage doors 

Entwined ^vith rose and honeysuclde, roared 

Like mountain-torrents now — Last, AVest, and South, 

As to the coasts \nth pike and musket streamed 

The trained bands, horse and foot, from every town 

And every hamlet. All the shaggy hills 

From Milford Haven to the Downs of Kent, 

And up to Ilumber, gleamed with many a hedge 

Of pikes between the beacon's crimson glares; 

While in red London fortj^ thousand men, 

Li case the Invader should prevail, drew swords 

Around their Queen. All night in dark St. Paid's, 

While round it rolled a multitudinous roar 

As of the Atlantic on a A\'estern beach. 

And all the leaning London streets were lit 

With fury of torches, rose the passionate prayer 

Of England's peril: 

Lord God of Hosts, 
Let Thine enemies know that Thou hast taken 
England into Thine hands! 

The mighty sound 
Rolled, billowing round the kneeling aisles, then died. 
Echoing up the heights. A voice, far off, 
As on the cross of Calvary, caught it up 
And poured the prayer o'er that deep hush, alone: 
We beseech Thee, God, to go before our armies, 
Bless and prosper them both by land and sea! 
Grant unto them Thy victory, God, 

As Thou uscdd to do to Thy children when they please Thee! 
All power, all strength, all victory come from Thee! 
Then from the lips of all those thousands burst 
A sound as from the rent heart of an ocean, 
One tumult, one great rushing storm of wings 



396  

Cleaving the darkness round the Gates of Heaven: 
Some pnt their trust in chariots and some in horses; 
Bid we will remember Thy name, Lord our God! 

So, while at Plymouth Sound her seamen toiled 

All through the night, and scarce a ship had won 

Seaward, the heart of England cried to God. 

All night, while trumpets yelled and blared without, 

And signal cannon shook the blazoned panes, 

And billowing multitudes went thundering by, 

Amid that solemn pillared hush arose 

From lips of kneeling thousands one great prayer 

Storming the Gates of Heaven ! Lord, our God, 

Heavenly Father, have mercy upon our Queen, 

To whom Thy far dispersed flock do fly 

In the anguish of their souls. Behold, behold, 

How many princes band themselves against her, 

How long Thy servant hath laboured to them for peace, 

How proudly they prepare themselves for battle! 

Arise, therefore! Maintain Thine own cause, 

Judge Thou between her and her eiiemies! 

She seeketh not her own honour, but Thine, 

Not the dominions of others, but Thy truth, 

Not bloodshed but the saving of the afflicted! 

rend the heavens, therefore, and come down, 

Deliver Thy people! 

To vanquish is all one with Thee, by few 

Or many, want or wealth, weakness or strength. 

The cause is Thine, the enemies Thine, the afflicted 

Thine! The honour, victory, and trimnph 

Thine! Grant her people now one heart, 07ie mind, 

One strength. Give unto her councils and her captains 

Wisdom and courage strongly to withstand 

The forces of her enemies, that the fame 

And glory of Thy Kingdom may be spread 

Unto the ends of the world. Father, we crave 

This in Thy mercy, for the precious death 

Of Thy dear Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ! 

Amen. 

And as the dreadful dawn thro' mist-wreaths broke, 

And out of Plymouth Sound at last, with checri: 



 397 

Ringing from many a thousand tliroats, tlicrc struggled 
Six little ships, all that the night's long toil 
Had warped down to the sea (but leading them 
The ship of Drake) there rose one ocean-cry 
From all those worshippers — Let God arise, 
And let His enemies be scattered! 



Under the leaden fogs of that new dawn, 

Empty and cold, indifferent as death, 

The sea heaved strangely to the seamen's e3'cs. 

Seeing all round them only the leaden surge 

Wrapped in wet mists or flashing here and there 

With crumbling white. Against the cold wet wind 

Westward the little ships of England beat 

With short tacks, close inshore, striving to win 

The windward station of the threatening battle 

That neared behind the veil. Six little ships. 

No more, beat Westward, even as all manldnd 

Beats up against that universal wind 

Whereon like withered leaves all else is blown 

Down one wide way to death : the soul alone. 

Whether at last it wins, or faints and fails, 

Stems the dark tide with its intrepid sails. 

Close-hauled, ^^^th many a short tack, struggled and strained, 

North-west, South-west, the ships; but ever Westward gained 

Some little way with every tack; and soon. 

While the prows plunged beneath the gre^^-gold noon, 

Lapped by the crackling waves, even as the wind 

Died down a little, in the mists behind 

Stole out from Plymouth Sound the struggling score 

Of ships that might not win last night to sea. 

They followed; but the Six went on before. 

Not knowing, alone, for God and Liberty. 



Now, as they tacked North-west, the sullen roar 
Of reefs crept out, or some strange tinkling sound 

Of sheep upon the hills. South-west once more 
The bo'sun's whistle swung their bowsprits round; 



398  

South-west until the long low lapping splash 
Was all they heard, of keels that still ran out 

Seaward, then with one muffled heave and crash 
Once more the whistles brought their sails about. 

And now the noon began to wane; the west 

With slow rich colours filled and shadowy forms, 

Dark curdling wreaths and fogs with crimsoned breast, 
And tangled zones of dusk like frozen storms, 

Motionless, flagged with sunset, hulled with doom! 

Motionless? Nay, across the darkening deep 
Surely the whole sky moved its gorgeous gloom 

Onward; and like the curtains of a sleep 

The red fogs crumbled, mists dissolved away! 

There, like death's secret dawning thro' a dream, 
Great thrones of thunder dusked the dying day. 

And, higher, pale towers of cloud began to gleam. 

There, in one heaven-wide storm, great masts and clouds 

Of sail crept slowly forth, the ships of Spain! 
From North to South, their tangled spars and shrouds 

Controlled the slow wind as with bit and rein; 
Onward they rode in insolent disdain 

Sighting the little fleet of England there, 
While o'er the sullen splendour of the main 

Three solemn guns tolled all their host to prayer, 
And their great ensign blazoned all the doom-fraught air. 

The sacred standard of their proud crusade 

Up to the mast-head of their flag-ship soared: 
On one side knelt the Holy Mother-maid, 

On one the crucified Redeemer poured 
His blood, and all their kneeling hosts adored 

Their saints, and clouds of incense heavenward stream^ed, 
While pomp of cannonry and pike and sword 

Down long sea-lanes of mocking menace gleamed, 
And chant of priests rolled out o'er seas that darldy dreamed. 



 399 

Who comes to fight for England? Is it ye, 

Six little straws that dance upon the foam? 
Ay, sweeping o'er the sunset-crimsoned sea 

Let the j)roud pageant in its glory come, 
Leaving the sunset like a hecatomb 

Of souls whose bodies yet endure the chain! 
Let slaves, by thousands, ])randed, scarred and dumb, 

In those dark galleys grip their oars again, 
And o'er the rolling deep bring on the pomp of Spain; — 



Bring on tlie pomp of royal paladins 

(For all the princedoms of the land are there!) 
And for the gorgeous purple of their sins 

The papal pomp bring on with psalm and prayer: 
Nearer the splendour heaves; can ye not hear 

The rushing foam, not see the blazoned arms. 
And black-faced hosts thro' leagues of golden air 

Crowding the decks, muttering their beads and charms 
To where, in furthest heaven, they thicken like locust-swarms? 

Bring on the pomp and pride of old Castille, 

Blazon the skies with royal Aragon, 
Beneath Oquendo let old ocean reel. 

The purple pomp of priestly Rome bring on; 
And let her censers dusk the dying sun. 

The thunder of her banners on the breeze 
Follo\\ing Sidonia's glorious galleon 

Deride the sleeping thunder of the seas. 
While twenty thousand warriors chant her litanies. 

Lo, all their decks are kneeling! Sky to sky 

Responds! It is their solemn evening hour. 
Salve Regina, though the daylight die. 

Salve Regina, though the darkness lour; 
Have they not still the kingdom and the power? 

Salve Regina, hark, their thousands cry, 
From where like clouds to where like mountains tower 

Their crowded galleons looming far or nigh, 
Salve Regina, hark, what distant seas rei)ly! 



400  

What distant seas, what distant ages hear? 

Bring on the pomp! the sun of Spain goes down: 
The moon but swells the tide of praise and prayer; 

Bring on the world-wide pomp of her renown; 
Let darkness crown her with a starrier crown, 

And let her watch the fierce waves crouch and fawn 
Round those huge hulks from which her cannon frown. 

While close inshore the wet sea-mists are drawn 
Round England's Drake: then wait, in triumph, for the dawn. 



The sun of Rome goes down; the night is dark! 

Still are her thousands praying, still their cry 
Ascends from the wide waste of waters, hark! 

Ave Maria, darker grows the sky! 
Ave Maria, those about to die 

Salute thee! Nay, what wandering winds blaspheme 
With random gusts of chilling prophecy 

Against the solemn sounds that heavenward stream! 
The night is come at last. Break not the splendid dream. 



But through the misty darkness, close inshore, 
North-west, South-west, and ever Westward strained 
The little ships of England. All night long, 
As down the coast the reddening beacons leapt, 
The crackle and lapping splash of tacking keels, 
The bo'suns' low sharp whistles and the whine 
Of ropes, mixing with many a sea-bird's cry 
Disturbed the darkness, waking vague swift fears 
Among the mighty hulks of Spain that lay 
Nearest, then fading through the mists inshore 
North-west, then growing again, but farther down 
Their ranks to Westward with each dark return 
And dark departure, till the rearmost rank 
Of grim sea-castles heard the swish and creak 
Pass plashing seavv'^ard thro' the wet sea-mists 
To windward now of all that monstrous host. 
Then heard no more than wandering sea-birds' cries 
Wheeling around their leagues of lanthorn-light. 
Or heave of waters, waiting for the dawn. 



 401 

Dawn, everlasting and almighty dawn 

Rolled o'er the waters. The f^rej' mists were fled. 
See, in their reeking heaven-wide crescent drawn 

Those masts and spars and cloudy sails, outspread 
Like one great sulphurous tempest soaked with red, 

In vain withstand the march of brightening skies: 
The dawn sweeps onward and the night is dead, 

And lo, to windward, what bright menace lies, 
What glory kindles now in England's wakening eyes? 



There, on the glittering plains of open sea. 

To windv/ard now, behind the fleets of Spain, 
Two little files of ships arc tossing free. 

Free of the winds and of the wind-swept main: 
Were they not trapped? Who brought them forth iigain. 

Free of the great new fields of England's war. 
With sails like blossoms shining after rain. 

And guns that sparkle to the morning star? 
Drake! — first upon the deep that rolls to Trafalgar! 

And Spain knows well that flag of fiery fame, 

Spain knows who leads those files across the sea; 
Implacable, invincible, his name 

El Draque, creeps hissing through her ranks to lee; 
But now she holds the rolling heavens in fee, 

His ships are few. They surge across the foam, 
The hunt is up! But need the mountains flee 

Or fear the snarling wolf -pack? Let them come! 
They crouch, but dare not leap upon the flanks of Rome. 

Nearer thej' come and nearer! Nay, prepare! 

Close your huge ranks that sweep from sky to sky! 
Madness itself would shrink; but  will dare 

Eternal hell! Let the great signal fly — 
Close up 5^our ranks; El Draque comes down to die! 

El Draque is brave ! The vast sea-cities loom 
Thro' heaven: Spain spares one smile of chivalry, 

One wintry smile across her cannons' gloom 
As that frail fleet full-sail comes rushing tow'rds its doom. 

26 



402  

Suddenly, as the wild change of a dream, 

Even as the Spaniards watched those lean sharp prows 

Leap straight at their huge hulks, watched well content, 

Knowing their foes, once grappled, must be doomed; 

Even as they caught the rush and hiss of foam 

Across that narrow, dwindling gleam of sea. 

And heard, abruptly close, the sharp commands 

And steady British answers, caught one glimpse 

Of bare-armed seamen waiting by their guns, 

The vision changed! The ships of England swerved 

Swiftly — a volley of flame and thunder swept 

Blinding the buffeted air, a volley of iron 

From four sheer broadsides, crashing thro' a hulk 

Of Spain. She reeled, blind in the fiery surge 

And fury of that assault. So swift it seemed 

That as she heeled to leeward, ere her guns 

Trained on the foe once more, the sulphurous cloud 

That wrapped the sea, once, twice, and thrice again 

Split with red thunder-claps that rent and raked 

Her huge beams through and through. Ay, as she heeled 

To leeward still, her own grim cannon belched 

Their lava skyward, wounding the void air, 

And, as by miracle, the ships of  

Were gone. Along the Spanish rear they swept 

From North to South, raking them as they went 

At close range, hardly a pistol-shot away, 

With volley on volley. Never Spain had seen 

Seamen or marksmen like to these who sailed 

Two knots against her one. They came and went, 

Suddenly neared or sheered away at will 

As if by magic, pouring flame and iron 

In four full broadsides thro' some Spanish hulk 

Ere one of hers burst blindly at the sky. 

Southward, along the Spanish rear they swept. 

Then swung about, and volleying sheets of flame, 

Iron, and death, along the same fierce road 

Littered with spars, reeking with sulphurous fumes, 

Returned, triumphantly rushing, all their sails 

Alow, aloft, full-bellied with the wind. 



 403 

Then, then, from sky to sky, one nuKhty surge 

Of baleful pride, liiio;e wratli, storiny disduiii, 
With sluidderinp; clouds and towers of sail would urpje 

Onward the heavinj; citadels of Spain, 
Which dras^efl earth's thunders o'er the groaning main, 

And held the panoplies of faith in fee, 
Beating against the wind, struggling in vain 

To close with tliat swift ocean-cavalry: 
Spain had all earth in charge! Had England, then, the sea? 



Spain had the mountains — mountains flow like clouds. 

Spain had great kingdoms — kingdoms melt away! 
Yet, in that crescent, army on army crowds, 

How shall she fear what seas or winds can say? — 
The seas that leap and shine round earth's decay. 

The ^^^nds that mount and sing while empires fall. 
And mountains pass like waves in the wind's way. 

And dying gods thro' shuddering twilights call. 
Had England, then, the sea that sweeps o'er one and all? 

See, in gigantic wrath the Rata hurls 

Her mighty prows round to the wild sea- wind: 
The deep like one black maelstrom round her swirls 

While great Recald6 follows hard behind: 
Reeling, like Titans, thunder-blasted, blind. 

They strive to cross the ships of England — yea, 
Challenge them to the grapple, and only find 

Red broadsides bursting o'er the bursting spray, 
And England surging still along her windward way! 

To windward still Revenge and Raleigh flash 

And thunder, and the sea flames red between: 
In vain against the wind the galleons crash 

And plunge and pour blind volleys thro' the screen 
Of rolling sulphurous clouds at dimly seen 

Topsails that, to and fro, like sea-birds fly! 
Ever to leeward the great hulks careen; 

Their thousand cannon can but wound the sky. 
While England's little Rainbow foams and flashes by. 



404  

Suddenly the flag-ship of Recald6, stung 

To fury it seemed, heeled like an avalanche 

To leeward, then reeled out beyond the rest 

Against the wind, alone, daring the foe 

To grapple her. At once the little Revenge 

With Drake's flag flying flashed at her throat, 

And hardly a cable's-length away out-belched 

Broadside on broadside, under those great cannon, 

Crashing through five-foot beams, four shots to one, 

While Howard and the rest swept to and fro 

Keeping at deadly bay the rolling hulks 

That looming like Leviathans now plunged 

Desperately against the freshening wind 

To rescue the great flag-ship where she lay 

Alone, amid the cannonades of Drake, 

Alone, like a volcanic island lashed 

With crimson hurricanes, dinning the winds 

With isolated thunders, flaking the skies 

With wrathful lava, while great spars and blocks 

Leapt through the cloudy glare and feU, far off, 



And so they came 
At dead of night on Callao de Lima! 
They saw the harbour lights across the waves 
Glittering, and the shadowy hulks of ships 
Gathered together like a flock of sheep 
Within the port. With shouts and clink of chains 
A shadowy ship was entering from the North, 
And like the shadow of that shadow slipped 
The Golden Hyndc beside her thro' the gloom; 
And side by side they anchored in the port 
Amidst the shipping! Over the dark tide 
A small boat from the customs-house drew near. 
A sleepy, yawning, gold-laced officer 
Boarded the Golden Hynde, and with a cry, 
Stumbling against a cannon-butt, he saw 
The bare-armed British seamen in the gloom 
All waiting by their guns. Wildly he plunged 
Over the side and urged his boat away, 
Crying, "El Draque! El Draque!" At that dread word 
The darkness filled with clamour, and the ships, 
Cutting their cables, drifted here and there 
In mad attempts to seek the open sea. 
Wild lights burnt hither and thither, and all the port, 



 335 

One furnace of confusion, licavcd and seethed 
In terror; for each shadow of the night, 
Nay, the great night itself, was all Kl Draquc. 
The Dragon's wings were spread from quay to quay, 
The very lights that burnt from mast to mast 
And flared across the tide kindled his breath 
To fire; while here and there a British pinnace 
Slipped softly thro' the roaring gloom and glare, 
Ransacking ship by ship; for each one thought 
A fleet had come upon them. Each gave up 
The struggle as each was boarded; while, elsewhere, 
Cannon to cannon, friends bombarded friends. 

Yet not one ounce of treasure in Callao 

They found; for, fourteen days before they came, 

That greatest treasure-ship of Spain, with all 

The gorgeous harvest of that year, had sailed 

For Panama: her ballast — silver bars; 

Her cargo — rubies, emeralds, and gold. 

Out through the clamour and the darkness, out, 

Out to the harbour mouth, the Golden Hynde, 

Steered by the iron soul of Drake, returned: 

And where the way was blocked, her cannon clove 

A crimson highway to the midnight sea. 

Then Northward, Northward, o'er the jewelled main. 

Under the white moon like a storm they drove 

In quest of the Cacafuego. Fourteen days 

Her start was; and at dawn the fair wind sank. 

And chafing lay the Golden Hynde, becalmed; 

While, on the hills, the Viceroy of Peru 

Marched down from Lima with two thousand men, 

And sent out four huge ships of war to sink 

Or capture the fierce Dragon. Loud laughed  

To see them creeping nigh, urged with great oars, 

Then suddenly pause; for none would be the first 

To close with him. And, ere they had steeled their hearts 

To battle, a fair breeze broke out anew. 

And Northward sped the little Golden Hynde 

In quest of the lordliest treasure-ship of Spain. 



3tJ5  

Behind her lay a world in arms; for now 

Wrath and confusion clamoured for revenge 

From sea to sea. Spain claimed the pirate's head 

From England, and awaited his return 

With all her tortures. And where'er he passed 

He sowed the dragon's teeth, and everywhere 

Cadmean broods of armed men arose 

And followed, followed on his fiery trail. 

Men toiled at Lima to fit out a fleet 

Grim enough to destroy him. All night long 

The flare went up from cities on the coast 

Where men like naked devils toiled to cast 

Cannon that might have overwhelmed the powers 

Of Michael when he drave that hideous rout 

Through livid chaos to the black abyss. 

Small hope indeed there seemed of safe return; 

But Northward sped the little Golden Hynde, 

The world-watched midget ship of eighteen guns, 

Undaunted; and upon the second dawn 

Sighted a galleon, not indeed the chase. 

Yet worth a pause; for out of her they took — 

Embossed with emeralds large as pigeon's eggs — 

A golden crucifix, with eighty pounds 

In weight of gold. The rest they left behind; 

And onward, onward, to the North they flew — 

A score of golden miles, a score of green, 

An hundred miles, eight hundred miles of foam, 

Rainbows and nre, ransacking as they went 

Ship after ship for news o' the chase and gold: 

Learning from every capture that they drew 

Nearer and nearer. At Truxillo, dim 

And dreaming city, a-drowse with purple flowers. 

She had paused, ay, paused to take a freight of gold! 

At Paita — she had passed two days in front, 

Only two days, two days ahead; nay, one! 

At Quito, close inshore, a youthful page. 

Bright-eyed, ran up the rigging and cried, ''A sail! 

A sail ! The Cacafuego! And the chain 

Is mine !" And by the strange cut of her sails, 

Whereof they had been told in Callao, 

They knew her! 



 337 

Heavily laden with her gems, 
Lazily drifting with her golden fruitage, 
Over the magic seas they saw her hull 
Loom as they onward drew; but Drake, for fear 
The prey might take alarm and run ashore, 
Trailed wine-skins, filled with water, over the side 
To hold his ship back, till the darkness fell. 
And with the night the off-shore wind arose. 
At last the sun sank down, tiie rosy light 
Faded from Andes' j)eaked and bosomed snow: 
The night-wind rose: the wine-skins were up-hauled; 
And, like a hound unleashed, the Golden Ilynde 
Leapt forward thro' the gloom. 

A cable's length 
Divided them. The Cacafucgo heard 
A rough voice in the darkness bidding her 
Heave to! She held her course.  gave the word. 
A broadside shattered the night, and over her side 
Her main-yard clattered like a broken wing! 
On to her decks the British sea-dogs swarmed, 
Cutlass in hand: that fight was at an end. 

The ship was cleared, a prize crew placed a-board, 

Then both ships turned their heads to the open sea. 

At dawn, being out of sight of land, they 'gan 

Examine the great prize. None ever knew 

Save  and Gloriana what wild wealth 

They had captured there. Thus much at least was known: 

An hundredweight of gold, and twenty tons 

Of silver bullion; thirteen chests of coins; 

Nuggets of gold unnumbered; countless pearls, 

Diamonds, emeralds; but the worth of these 

Was past all reckoning. In the crimson dawn, 

Ringed with the lonely pomp of sea and sky, 

The naked-footed seamen bathed knee-deep 

In gold and gathered up Aladdin's fruit — 

All-colored gems — and tossed them in the sun. 

The hold like one great elfin orchard gleamed 

With dusky globes and tawny glories piled, 

Hesperian apples, heap on mellow heap. 

Rich with the hues of sunset, rich and ripe

And Xorthwnrd. till the soft luxurious coasts 

Hardened, the winds grew bleak, the great green waves 

Loomed high like mountains round them, and the spray 

Froze on their spars and yards. Fresh from the warmth 

Of tropic seas the men could hardly brook 

That cold; and when the floating hills of ice 

Like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow 

Went past them with strange whispers in the gloom, 

Or took mysterious colours in the dawn, 

Their hearts misgave them, and they found no way; 

But all was iron shore and icy sea. 

And one by one the crew fell sick to death 

In that fierce ^nnter. and the land still ran 

Westward and showed no passage. Tossed \\-ith storms, 

Onward they plunged, or furrowed gentler tides 

Of ice-lit emerald that made the prow 

A faery beak of some enchanted ship 

Flinging wild rainbows round her as she drove 

Thro' seas unsailed by mortal mariners. 

Past isles unhailed of any human voice, 

Where sound and silence mingled in one song 

Of utter solitude. Ever as they went 

The flag of England blazoned the broad breeze, 

Northward, where never ship had sailed before, 

Northward, till lost in helpless wonderment, 

Dazed as a soul awakening from the dream 

Of death to some wild dawn in Paradise 

(Yet burnt with cold as they whose very tears 

Freeze on their faces where Cocytus wails) 

All world-worn, bruised, wing-broken, 'RTacked, and wrenched, 

Blackened -^-ith lightning, scarred as with evil deeds, 

But all embalmed in beauty by that sun 

Which never sets, bosomed m peace at last 

The Gohien Hynde rocked on a glittering calm. 

Seas that no ship had ever sailed, from sky 

To glistening sky. swept round them. Glory and gleam, 

Glamour and lucid rapture and diamond air 

Embraced her broken spars, begrimed with gold 

Her gloomy hull, rocking upon a sphere 

New made, it seemed, mysterious with the first 

Mj'stery of the world, vrhere holy sky 



 341 

And sacred sea shone like the primal Light 
Of God, a-stir with wlii.speiinj:; sea-bird's wings 
And glorious with clouds. Only, all day, 
All night, the rhythmic utterance of His will 
In the deep sigh of seas that washed His tiirone, 
Rose and relapsed across Eternity, 
Timed to the pulse of leons. All their world 
Seemed strange as unto us the great new heavens 
And glittering shores, if on some aery bark 
To Saturn's coasts we came and traced no more 
The tiny gleam of our familiar earth 
Far ofT, but heard tremendous oceans roll 
Round unimagined continents, and saw 
Terrible mountains unto which our Alps 
Were less than mole-hills, and such gaunt ra\anes 
Cleaving them and such cataracts roaring down 
As burst the gates of our earth-moulded senses, 
Pour the eternal glory on our souls. 
And, while ten thousand chariots bring the dawn, 
Hurl us poor midgets trembling to our knees. 
Glory and glamour and rapture of lucid air, 
Ice cold, with subtle colours of the sky 
Embraced her broken spars, belted her hulk 
With brilliance, while she dipped her jacinth beak 
In waves of mounded splendour, and sometimes 
A great ice-mountain flashed and floated by 
Throned on the waters, pinnacled and crowned 
With all the smouldering jewels in the world; 
Or in the darkness, glimmering berg on berg, 
All emerald to the moon, went by like ghosts 
Whispering to the South. 

There, as they lay, 
Waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails, 
Their hearts remembered that in England now 
The Spring was nigh, and in that lonely sea 
The skilled musicians filled their eyes with home.

SONG 
I 

It is the Spring-tide now! 
Under the hawthorn-bough 

The milkmaid goes: 
Her eyes are violets blue 
Washed with the morning dew. 

Her mouth a rose. 

It is the Spring-tide now. 



II 

The lanes are growing 

The lambkins frisk and bleat 

In all the meadows: 
The glossy dappled kine 
Blink in the warm sunshine, 

Cooling their shadows. 
It is the Spring-tide now. 



Ill 

Soon hand in sunburnt hand 
Thro' God's green fairyland, 

England, our home, 
Whispering as they stray 
Adown the primrose wo,y, 

Lovers will roam. 

It is the Spring-tide now. 

And then, with many a chain of linked sweetness, 
Harmonious gold, they drew their hearts and soul? 
Back, back to England, thoughts of wife and child 
Mother and sweetheart and the old companions, 
The twisted streets of London and the deep 
Delight of Devon lanes, all softly voiced 
In words or cadences, made them breathe hard 
And gaze across the everlasting sea. 
Craving for that small isle so far away. 



 343 

SONG 

I 

0, you beautiful land, 

Dccp-bosomcd with beeches and bright 
With the flowery largesse of May 
Sweet from the palm of her hand 
Out-flung, till the hedges grew white 
As the green-arched billows with spray. 

II 

White from the fall of her feet 
The daisies awake in the sun ! 
Cliff-side and valley and plain 
With the breath of the thyme growing sweet 
Laugh, for the Spring is begun; 

And Love hath turned homeward again. 

0, you beautiful land! 



Ill 

Where should the home be of Love, 

But there, where the hawthorn-tree blows, 
And the milkmaid trips out with her pail, 
And the skylark in heaven above 
Sings, till the West is a rose 
And the East is a nightingale? 

0, you beautiful land! 

IV 

There where the sycamore trees 
Are shading the satin-skinned kine, 
And oaks, whose brethren of old 
Conquered the strength of the seas, 
Grow broad in the sunlight and shine 
Crowned with their cressets of gold; 

0, you bcaidiful land! 



544 DRAIvE 

V 

Deep-bosomed with beeches and bright 
With rose-coloured cloudlets above; 
Billowing broad and grand 
Wliere the meadows "U'ith blossom are white 
For the foot-fall, the foot-fall of Love. 
0, 3'ou beautiful land! 



VI 



How should we sing of thy beauty, 
England, mother of men. 

We that can look in thine eyes 
And see there the splendour of duty 
Deep as the depth of their ken, 
Wide as the ring of thy skies. 



VII 

0, you beautifvl land, 

Deep-bosomed with beeches and bright 
With the flowery largesse of May 
Sweet from the palm of her hand 
Out-flung, till the hedges grew ivhite 
As the green-arched billows with spray, 

0, you beautiful land! 



And w^hen a fair wind rose again, there seemed 
No hope of passage by that fabled way 
Northward, and suddenly  put down his helm 
And, with some wondrous purpose in his eyes, 
Turned Southward once again, until he found 
A lonely natural harbour on the coast 
Near San Francisco, where the cliffs were white 
Like those of England, and the soft soil teemed 
With gold. There they careened the Golden Hyndc — 



 345 

Her keel being thick with barnacles and weeds — 

And built a fort and dockyard to refit 

Tlieir little wandering home, not half so large 

As many a coasting barque to-day that scarce 

Would cross the Channel, yet she had swept the seas 

Of half the world, and even now jjrepared 

For nev.' adventures greater than them all. 

And as the sound of chisel and hammer broke 

The stillness of that shore, shy figures came, 

Keen-faced and grave-eyed Indians, from the woods 

To bow before the strange white-faced newcomers 

As gods. Whereat the chaplain all aghast 

Persuaded them with signs and broken words 

And grunts that even  was but a man, 

Whom none the less the savages would crown 

With woven flowers and barbarous ritual 

King of New Albion — so the seamen called 

That land, remembering the white chffs of home. 

IMucli they implored, with many a sign and cry, 

Which by the rescued slaves upon the prize 

Were part interpreted, that  would stay 

And rule them; and the vision of the great 

I^mpire of Englishmen arose and flashed 

A moment round them, on that lonely shore. 

A small and weather-beaten band they stood, 

Bronzed seamen by the laughing rescued slaves, 

Ringed with gigantic loneliness and saw 

An Empire that should liberate the world; 

A Power before the lightning of whose arms 

Darkness should die and all oppression cease; 

A Federation of the strong and weak, 

Whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong 

]\Iade stronger in the increasing good of all; 

A gathering up of one another's loads; 

A turning of the wasteful rage of war 

To accomphsh large and fruitful tasks of peace. 

Even as the strength of some great stream is turned 

To grind the corn for bread. E'en thus on England 

That splendour dawned which those in dreams foresaw 

And saw not with their living eyes, but thou, 

England, mayst lift up eyes at last and see. 



346 drai^:e 

Who, like that angel of the Apocalypse 
Hast set one foot upon thy sea-girt isle, 
The other upon the waters, and canst raise 
Now, if thou wilt, above the assembled nations, 
The trumpet of deliverance to thy lips. 

At last their task was done, the Goldfn Hynde 

Undocked, her white wings hoisted; and away 

Westward they swiftly glided from the shore 

Where, with a wild lament, their Indian friends, 

Knee-deep i' the creaming foam, all stood at gaze, 

Like men that for one moment in their lives 

Have seen a mighty drama cross their path 

And played upon the stage of vast events 

Knowing, henceforward, all their life is nought. 

But Westward sped the little Golden Hynde 

Across the uncharted ocean, with no guide 

But that great homing cry of all their hearts. 

Far out of sight of land they steered, straight out 

Across the great Pacific, in those days 

When even the compass proved no trusty guide. 

Straight out they struck in that small bark, straight out 

Week after week, without one glimpse of aught 

But heaving seas, across the uncharted waste 

Straight to the sunset. Laughingly they sailed, 

With all that gorgeous booty in their holds, 

A splendour dragging deep through seas of doom, 

A prey to the first great hurricane that blew 

Except their God averted it. And still 

Their skilled musicians cheered the way along 

To shores bej^ond the sunset and the sea. 

And oft at nights, the yellow fo'c'sle lanthorn 

Swung over swarthy singing faces grouped 

Within the four small wooden walls that made 

Their home and shut them from the unfathomable 

Depths of mysterious gloom without that rolled 

All around them; or Tom Moone would heartily troll 

A simple stave that struggled oft with thoughts 

Beyond its reach, yet reached their hearts no less. 



 347 

SONG 

I 

Good luck befall you, mariners all 

That sail this worhl so iridc! 
Whither ire go, not yet we know: 

ire steer by wind and tide. 
Be it right or wrong, I sing this song; 

For now it seems to mc 
Men steer their soils thr ' r cks and shoals 

As marinerc use by sea. 

Chorus: As mariners use by sea, 
My lads. 
As mariners use by sea! 



II 



And now they plough to windward, now 

They drive before the gale! 
Now are they hurled aeross the world 

With torn and tattered sail; 
Yet, as they will, they steer and still 

Defy the world's rude glee: 
Till death overwhelm them, mast and helm, 

They ride and rule the sea. 

Chorus: They ride and rule the sea, 
My lads, 
They ride and rule the sea! 



Meantime, in England, Bess of Sydenham, 

Drake's love and queen, being told that  was dead, 

And numbed with grief, obeying her father's will 

That dreadful summer morn in bridal robes 

Had passed to wed her father's choice. The sun 

Streamed smiling on her as she went, half-dazed, 

Amidst her smiling maids. Nigh to the sea 



348  

The church was, and the mellow marriage bells 

IMixed with its music. Far away, white sails 

Spangled the sapphire, white as flying blossoms 

New-fallen from her crown; but as the glad 

And sad procession neared the little church, 

From some strange ship-of-war, far out at sea, 

There came a sudden tiny puff of smoke — 

And then a dull strange throb, a whistling hiss, 

And scarce a score of yards away a shot 

Ploughed up the turf. None knew, none ever knew 

From whence it came, whether a perilous jest 

Of English seamen, or a wanton deed 

Of Spaniards, or mere accident; but all 

Her maids in flight were scattered. Bess awoke 

As from a dream, crying aloud — " 'Tis he, 

'Tis he that sends this message. He is not dead. 

I will not pass the porch. Come home with me. 

'Twas he that sent that message.'' 

Nought availed, 
Her father's wTath, her mother's tears, her maids' 
Cunning persuasions, nought; home she returned, 
And waited for the dead to come to life; 
Nor waited long; for ere that month was out, 
Rumour on rumour reached the coasts of England, 
Borne as it seemed on sea-birds' wings, that  
Was on his homeward way. 

BOOK VII 

The imperial '^Tath of Spain, one world-wide sea 

Of furious pomp and flouted power, now surged 

All round this little isle, with one harsh roar 

Deepening for Drake's return — "The Golden Hynde 

Ye swore had foundered,  ye svv'ore was drowned; 

They are on their homeward way! The head of Drake! 

What answer, what account, what recompense 

Now can ye yield our might invincible 

Except the head of Drake, whose bloody deeds 

Have reddened the Pacific, who hath sacked 

Cities of gold, burnt fleets, and ruined realms. 

What answer but his life?" 



 349 

To which the Queen 
Who saw the storm of Europe slowly rising 
In a\vful menace o'er her wave-beat throne, 
And midmost of the storm, the ensanguined robes 
Of Rome and murderous hand, grasping the Cross 
By its great hilt, pointing it like a brand 
Blood-l)lackened at the throat of England, saw 
Like skeleton castles wTapt in rolling mist 
The monstrous engines and designs of war, 
The secret fleets and brooding panoplies 
Philip prepared, growing from day to day 
In dusk armipotent and embattled gloom 
Surrounding her, replied: "The life of Drake, 
If, on our strict enquiry, in due order 
We find that  have hurt our friends, mark well, 
If  have hurt our friends, the life of Drake." 



And while the world awaited him, as men 

Might wait an earthquake, quietly one grey morn, 

One grey October morn of mist and rain 

When all the \vindow-panes in Plymouth dripped 

With listless drizzle, and only through her streets 

Rumbled the death-cart with its dreary bell 

Monotonously plangent (for the plague 

Had lately like a vampire sucked the veins 

Of Plymouth town), a little weed-clogged ship, 

Grey as a ghost, glided into the Sound 

And anchored, scarce a soul to see her come, 

And not an eye to read the faded scroll 

Around her battered prow — the Golden Hyndc. 

Then, thro' the dumb grey misty listless port, 

A rumour like the colours of the dawn 

Streamed o'er the shining quaj's, up the wet streets. 

In at the tavern doors, flashed from the panes 

And turned them into diamonds, fired the pools 

In every muddy lane with Spanish gold, 

Flushed in a thousand faces,  is come! 

Down every crowding alley the urchins leaped 

Tossing their caps, the Golden Hynde is come! 



350  

Fisherman, citizen, prentice, dame and maid, 

Fat justice, floury baker, bloated butcher, 

Fishwife, minister and apothecary. 

Yea, even the driver of the death-cart, leaving 

His ghastly load, using his dreary bell 

To merrier purpose, down the seething streets, 

Panting, tumbling, jostling, helter-skelter 

To the water-side, to the water-side they rushed, 

And some knee-deep beyond it, all one wild 

Welcome to Francis Drake! 

Wild kerchiefs fluttering, thunderous hurrahs 

Rolling from quay to quay, a thousand arms 

Outstretched to that grey ghostly little ship 

At whose masthead the British flag still flew; 

Then, over all, in one tumultuous tide 

Of pealing joy, the Plymouth bells outclashed 

A nation's welcome home to Francis Drake. 

The very Golden Hynde, no idle dream. 

The little ship that swept the Spanish Main, 

Carelessly lying there, in Plymouth Sound, 

The Golden Hynde, the wonder of the world, 

A glory wrapt her greyness, and no boat 

Dared yet approach, save one, with Drake's close friends, 

Who came to warn him: ''England stands alone 

And  is made the price of England's peace. 

The Queen, perforce, must temporise with Spain, 

The Invincible! She hath forfeited thy life 

To Spain, against her will. Only by this 

Rejection of thee as a privateer 

She averted instant war; for now the menace 

Of Spain draws nigher, looms darker every hour. 

The world is made Spain's footstool. Philip, the King, 

E'en now hath added to her boundless power 

Without a blow, the vast domains and wealth 

Of Portugal, and deadlier yet, a coast 

That crouches over against us. Cadiz holds 

A huge Armada, none knows where to strike; 

And even this day a flying horseman brought 

Rumours that Spain hath landed a great force 

In Ireland. Mary of Scotland only waits 



 351 

The word to stab us in the side for Rome. 

The Queen, weighed down by Burleigh nnd tlie friends 

Of peace at any cost, may yet be driven 

To make thy life our ransom, which indeed 

She liatii already sworn, or seemed to swear." 

To whom  answered, "Gloriana lives; 
And in her life mine only fear lies dead, 
Mine only fear, for luigland, not myself. 
Willing am I and glad, as 1 have lived, 
To die for England's sake. 
Yet, lest the Queen be driven now to restore 
This cargo that I bring her — a world's wealth, 
The golden sj)rings of all the power of Spain, 
The jewelled hearts of all those cruel realms 
(For I have plucked them out) beyond the sea; 
Lest she be driven to yield them up again 
For Spain and Spain's delight, I will warp out 
Behind St. Nicholas' Island. The fierce plague 
In Plymouth shall be colour and excuse. 
Until my courier return from court 
With Gloriana's will. If it be death, 
I'll out again to sea, strew its rough floor 
With costlier largesses than kings can throw, 
And, ere I die, will singe the Spaniard's beard 
And set the fringe of his imperial robe 
Blazing along his coasts. Then let him roll 
His galleons round the little Golden Hynde, 
Bring her to bay, if he can, on the high seas, 
Ring us about with thousands, we'll not yield, 
I and my Golden Hynde, we will go down, 
W^ith flag still flying on the last stump left us 
And all my cannon spitting out the fires 
Of everlasting scorn into his face." 

So  warped out the Golden Hijnde anew 
Behind St. Nicholas' Island. She lay there, 
The small grey-golden centre of the world 
That raged all round her, the last hope, the star 
Of Protestant freedom, she, the outlawed ship 
Holding within her the great head and heart 



352  

Of England's ocean power; and all tlie fleets 
That have enfranchised earth, in that small ship, 
Lay waiting for their doom. 

Past her at night 
Fisher-boats glided, wondering as they heard 
In the thick darkness the great songs they deemed 
Must oft have risen from many a lonely sea; 
For oft had Spaniards brought a rumour back 
Of that strange pirate who in royal state 
Sailed to a sound of violins, and dined 
With skilled musicians round him, turning all 
Battle and storm and death into a song. 

SONG 

The same Sun is o'er us. 

The same Love shall find us, 

The same and none other 

Wherever we be; 

With the same hope before us, 

The same home behind us, 

England, our mother. 

Ringed round with the sea. 

No land in the ring of it 
Now, all around us 
Only the splendid 
Re-surging unknown; 
How should we sing of it. 
This that hath found us 
By the great stars attended 
At midnight, alone? 

Our highway none knoweth. 

Yet our blood hath discerned it! 
Clear, clear is our path now 
Wliose foreheads are free 
Where the hurricane bloweth 
Our spirits have learned it, 

'Tis the highway of wTath, now, 
The storm's way, the sea. 



 353 

When the waters lay breathless 
Gazing at Hesper 

Guarding that glorious 
Fruitage of gold, 
Heard we the deathless 
Wonderful whisper 
We follow, victorious 
To-night, as of old. 

Ah, the broad miles of it 
White with the onset 
Of waves without number 
Warring for glee; 
Ah, the soft smiles of it 
Down to the sunset, 
Sacred for slumber 

The swan's bath, the sea! 

When the breakers charged thundering 
In thousands all round us 
With a lightning of lances 
Up-hurtled on high, 
When the stout ships were sundering 
A rapture hath crowned us 
Like the wild light that dances 
On the crests that flash by. 

Our highway none knoweth, 
Yet our blood hath discerned it! 
Clear, clear is our path now 
Whose foreheads are free, 
Where Euroclydon hlowelh 
Our spirits have learned it, 

'Tis the highway of wrath, now, 
The storm 's way, the sea! 

Who now will follow us 

Where England's flag leadeth us, 
Where gold not inveigles. 
Nor statesmen betray? 



354.  

Tho' the deep midnight swallow us 
Let her cry when she needeth us, 
We return, her sea-eagles, 
The hurricane's way. 

For the same Sun is o'er us, 
The same Love shall find us, 
The same and none other 
Wherever we he; 
With the same hope before us, 
The same home behind us, 
England, our mother, 

Ringed round with the sea. 

So six days passed, and on the seventh returned 

The courier, with a message from the Queen 

Summoning  to court, bidding him bring 

Also such curious trifles of his voyage 

As might amuse her, also be of good cheer 

She bade him, and rest well content his life 

In Gloriana's hands were safe: so  

Laughingly landed with his war-bronzed crew 

Amid the wide-eyed throng on Plymouth beach 

And loaded twelve big pack-horses with pearls 

Beyond all price, diamonds, crosses of gold. 

Rubies that smouldered once for Aztec kings, 

And great dead Incas' gem-encrusted crowns. 

Also, he said, we'll add a sack or twain 

Of gold doubloons, pieces of eight, moidores. 

And such-like Spanish trash, for those poor lords 

At court, lilies that toil not neither spin. 

Wherefore, methinks their purses oft grow lean 

In these harsh times. 'Twere even as well their tongues 

Wagged in our favour, now, as in our blame. 



Six days thereafter a fearful whisper reached 
Mendoza, plenipotentiary of Spain 
In London, that the pirate  was now 
In secret conference with the Queen, nay more, 



 355 

That he, the Master-thief of the frj^ldcn world, 

Drake, even he, that bloody buccaneer, 

Had six hours' audience with her Majesty 

Daily, nay more, walked with her in her garden 

Alone, among the fiery Autumn leaves, 

Talking of God knows what, and suddenly 

The temporizing diplomatic voice 

Of caution he was wont to expect from England 

And blandl}'- accept as his imperial due 

Changed to a ringing key of firm resolve. 

Resistance, nay, defiance. For when he came 

Demanding audience of the Queen, behold, 

Her officers of state with mouths awry 

Informed the high ambassador of Spain, 

Despite his pomp and circumstance, the Queen 

Could not receive him, being in conference 

With some rough seaman, pirate, what you will, 

A fellow made of bronze, a buccaneer, 

Maned like a lion, bearded like a pard, 

With hammered head, clamped jaws, and great deep eyes 

That burned with fierce blue colours of the brine, 

And liked not Spain — Drake! 'Twas the very name. 

One Francis Drake! a Titan that had stood. 

Thundering commands against the thundering heavens. 

On lightning-shattered, storm-swept decks and drunk 

Great draughts of glory from the rolling sea, 

El Draque! El Draque! Nor could she promise aught 

To Spain's ambassador, nor see his face 

Again, while yet one Spanish musketeer 

Remained in Ireland. 

Vainly the Spaniard raged 
Of restitution, recompense; for now 
Had  brought up the little Golden Ilynde 
To London, and the rumor of her wealth 
Out-topped the wild reality. The crew 
Were princes as they swaggered down the streets 
In weather-beaten splendour. Out of their doors 
To wonder and stare the jostling citizens ran 
When They went by; and through the length and breadth 
Of England, now, the gathering glory of life 
Shone like the dawn. O'er hill and dale it streamed. 



356  

Dawn, everlasting and almighty dawn, 
Making a golden pomp of every oak — 
Had not its British brethren swept the seas? — 
In each remotest hamlet, by the hearth, 
The cart, the grey church-porch, the village pump 
By meadow and mill and old manorial hall, 
By turnpike and by tavern, farm and forge. 
Men staved the crimson vintage of romance 
And held it up against the light and drank it, 
And with it drank confusion to the wrath 
That menaced England, but eternal honour, 
While blood ran in their veins, to Francis Drake. 



BOOK VIII 

Meanwhile, young Bess of Sydenham, the queen 

Of Drake's deep heart, emprisoned in her home. 

Fenced by her father's angry watch and ward 

Lest he — the poor plebeian dread of Spain, 

Shaker of nations, king of the untamed seas — 

Might win some word with her, sweet Bess, the flower 

Triumphant o'er their rusty heraldries. 

Waited her lover, as in ancient tales 

The pale princess from some grey wizard's tower 

Midmost the deep sigh of enchanted woods 

Looks for the starry flash of her knight's shield; 

Or on the further side o' the magic West 

Sees pushing through the ethereal golden gloom 

Some blurred black prow, with loaded colours coarse, 

Clouded with sunsets of a mortal sea, 

And rich with earthly crimson. She, with lips 

Apart, still waits the shattering golden thrill 

When it shall grate the coasts of Fairyland. 

Only, to Bess of Sydenham, there came 
No sight or sound to break that frozen spell 
And lonely watch, no message from her love. 
Or none that reached her restless helpless hands. 
Only the general rumour of the world 
Borne to her by the gossip of her maid 



 357 

Kept the swift pictures passing througli her brain 

Of how the Golden Hynde was hauled ashore 

At Deptford through a sea of exultation, 

And by the (Queen's command was now set up 

For an everlasting memory! 

Of how the Queen with subtle statecraft still 

Kept Spain at arm's-length, dangling, while she played 

At fast and loose with France, w^hosc embassy, 

Arriving with the marriage-treaty, found 

(And trembled at her daring, since the wTath 

Of Spain seemed, in their eyes, to flake with foam 

The storm-beat hulk) a gorgeous banquet spread 

To greet them on that ver}'- Golden Hynde 

Which sacked the Spanish main, a gorgeous feast, 

The like of which old England had not seen 

Since the bluff days of boisterous king Hal, 

Great shields of brawn with mustard, roasted swans, 

Haunches of venison, roasted chines of beef. 

And chewets baked, big olive-pyes thereto, 

And sallets mixed with sugar and cinnamon, 

White ^vine, rose-water, and candied eringoes. 

There, on the outlawed ship, whose very name 

Rang like a blasphemy in the imperial ears 

Of Spain (its every old worm-eaten plank 

Being scored with scorn and courage that not storm 

Nor death, nor all their Inquisition racks. 

The white-hot irons and bloody branding whips 

That scarred the backs of Ptome's pale galley-slaves. 

Her captured English seamen, ever could daunt), 

There with huge Empires waiting for one word. 

One breath of colour and excuse, to leap 

Like w^olves at the naked throat of her small isle. 

There in the eyes of the staggered w^orld she stood. 

Great Gloriana, while the live decks reeled 

With flash of jewels and flush of rustling silks. 

She stood wath Drake, the corsair, and her people 

Surged like a sea around. There did she give 

Open defiance wath her agate smile 

To Spain. ''Behold this pirate, now," she cried, 

"Whose head my Lord, the Invincible, Philip of Spain 

Demands from England. Kneel dowai. Master Drake, 



358  

Kneel down; for now have I this gilded sword 
Wherewith to strike it off. Nay, thou my lord 
Ambassador of France, since I be woman, 
And squeamish at the sight of blood, give thou 
The accolade." With that jest she gave the hilt 
(Thus, even in boldness, playing a crafty part, 
And dangling France before the adventurous deed) 
To Marchaumont; and in the face of Europe, 
With that huge fleet in Cadiz and the whole 
World-power of Spain crouching around her isle, 
Knighted the master-thief of the unknown world, 
Sir Francis Drake. 

And then the rumour came 
Of vaster privateerings planned by  
Against the coasts of Philip; but held in check 
And fretting at the leash, as ever the Queen 
Clung to her statecraft, while Drake's enemies 
Worked in the dark against him. Spain had set 
An emperor's ransom on his life. At home 
John Doughty, treacherous brother of that traitor 
Who met his doom by Drake's own hand, intrigued 
With Spain abroad and Spain's dark emissaries 
At home to avenge his brother. Burleigh still 
Beset Drake's path with pitfalls: treacherous greed 
For Spain's blood-money daggered all the dark 
Around him, and John Doughty without cease 
Sought to make use of all; until, by chance, 
 gat the proof of treasonable intrigue 
With Spain, against him, up to the deadly hilt. 
And hurled him into the Tower. 

Many a night 
She sat by that old casement nigh the sea 
And heard its ebb and flow. With soul erect 
And splendid now she waited, yet there came 
No message; and, she thought, he hath seen at last 
My little worth. And when her maiden sang. 
With white throat throbbing softly in the dusk 
And fingers gently straying o'er the lute. 
As was her wont at twilight, some old song 
Of high disdainful queens and lovers pale 
Pining a thousand years before their feet. 






See they come, post haste from Thanet,
Lovely couple, side by side;
They've left behind them Richard Kennet
With the Parents of the Bride! 
Canterbury they have passed through;
Next succeeded Stamford-bridge;
Chilham village they came fast through;
Now they've mounted yonder ridge. 

Down the hill they're swift proceeding,
Now they skirt the Park around;
Lo! The Cattle sweetly feeding
Scamper, startled at the sound! 

Run, my Brothers, to the Pier gate!
Throw it open, very wide!
Let it not be said that we're late
In welcoming my Uncle's Bride! 

To the house the chaise advances;
Now it stops--They're here, they're here!
How d'ye do, my Uncle Francis?
How does do your Lady dear? 


Miss Lloyd has now sent to Miss Green,
As, on opening the box, may be seen,
Some years of a Black Ploughman's Gauze,
To be made up directly, because
Miss Lloyd must in mourning appear
For the death of a Relative dear--
Miss Lloyd must expect to receive
This license to mourn and to grieve,
Complete, ere the end of the week--
It is better to write than to speak 

Happy the lab'rer in his Sunday clothes!
In light-drab coat, smart waistcoat, well-darn'd hose,
Andhat upon his head, to church he goes;
As oft, with conscious pride, he downward throws
A glance upon the ample cabbage rose
That, stuck in button-hole, regales his nose,
He envies not the gayest London beaux.
In church he takes his seat among the rows,
Pays to the place the reverence he owes,
Likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows,
Lists to the sermon in a softening doze,
And rouses joyous at the welcome close. 

Ever musing I delight to tread 
The Paths of honour and the Myrtle Grove 
Whilst the pale Moon her beams doth shed 
On disappointed Love. 
While Philomel on airy hawthorn Bush 
Sings sweet and Melancholy, And the thrush 
Converses with the Dove. 

2

Gently brawling down the turnpike road, 
Sweetly noisy falls the Silent Stream-- 
The Moon emerges from behind a Cloud 
And darts upon the Myrtle Grove her beam. 
Ah! then what Lovely Scenes appear, 
The hut, the Cot, the Grot, and Chapel queer, 
And eke the Abbey too a mouldering heap, 
Cnceal'd by aged pines her head doth rear 
And quite invisible doth take a peep. 


Oh! Mr. Best, you're very bad
And all the world shall know it;
Your base behaviour shall be sung
By me, a tunefull Poet.-- 
You used to go to Harrowgate
Each summer as it came,
And why I pray should you refuse
To go this year the same?-- 

The way's as plain, the road's as smooth,
The Posting not increased;
You're scarcely stouter than you were,
Not younger Sir at least.-- 

If e'er the waters were of use
Why now their use forego?
You may not live another year,
All's mortal here below.-- 

It is your duty Mr Best
To give your health repair.
Vain else your Richard's pills will be,
And vain your Consort's care. 

But yet a nobler Duty calls
You now towards the North.
Arise ennobled--as Escort
Of Martha Lloyd stand forth. 

She wants your aid--she honours you
With a distinguished call.
Stand forth to be the friend of her
Who is the friend of all.-- 

Take her, and wonder at your luck,
In having such a Trust.
Her converse sensible and sweet
Will banish heat and dust.-- 

So short she'll make the journey seem
You'll bid the Chaise stand still.
T'will be like driving at full speed
From Newb'ry to Speen hill.-- 

Convey her safe to Morton's wife
And I'll forget the past,
And write some verses in your praise
As finely and as fast. 

But if you still refuse to go
I'll never let your rest,
Buy haunt you with reproachful song
Oh! wicked Mr. Best!--    


I've a pain in my head' 
Said the suffering Beckford; 
To her Doctor so dread. 
'Oh! what shall I take for't?'

Said this Doctor so dread 
Whose name it was Newnham. 
'For this pain in your head 
Ah! What can you do Ma'am?'

Said Miss Beckford, 'Suppose 
If you think there's no risk, 
I take a good Dose 
Of calomel brisk.'--

'What a praise worthy Notion.' 
Replied Mr. Newnham. 
'You shall have such a potion 
And so will I too Ma'am.'


This little bag I hope will prove
To be not vainly made--
For, if you should a needle want
It will afford you aid. 
And as we are about to part
T'will serve another end,
For when you look upon the Bag
You'll recollect your friend 
Jane Austen

Love One Another By Khalil Gibran (aka Kahlil Jubran)
Love one another, but make not a bond of love.
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
Fill each other’s cup, but drink not from one cup.
Give one another of your bread, but eat not from the same loaf.
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone.
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.
For only the hand of life can contain your hearts.
And stand together, yet not too near together.
For the pillars of the temple stand apart.
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.

How Do I Love Thee by Elizabeth Barrett Browning
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.

love poems for your boyfriend that will make him cry

 

A Drinking Song by W.B. Yeats
Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That’s all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.

Famous Deep Love Poems by W.B. Yeats 

Another Valentine by Wendy Cope
Today we are obliged to be romantic
And think of yet another valentine.
We know the rules and we are both pedantic:
Today’s the day we have to be romantic.
Our love is old and sure, not new and frantic.
You know I’m yours and I know you are mine.
And saying that has made me feel romantic,
My dearest love, my darling valentine.

Another Valentine by Wendy Cope from Deep Famous Love Poems Collection

Bright Star by John Keats
Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art–
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors–
No–yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever–or else swoon to death.

 ‘Bright Star’ by John Keats from Famous Deep Love Poetry Collection for him

Meeting at Night by Robert Browning
The gray sea and the long black land;
And the yellow half-moon large and low:
And the startled little waves that leap
In fiery ringlets from their sleep,
As I gain the cove with pushing prow,
And quench its speed i’ the slushy sand.

Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch
And blue spurt of a lighted match,
And a voice less loud, through joys and fears,
Than the two hearts beating each to each!

My River by Emily Dickinson
My river runs to thee.
Blue sea, wilt thou welcome me?
My river awaits reply.
Oh! sea, look graciously.

I’ll fetch thee brooks
from spotted nooks.
Say, sea, Take me!

deep meaningful love poems for him

Love’s Philosophy by Percy Bysshe Shelley
The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
Why not I with thine?—

See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea:
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?

You might enjoy the selection of amazing love poems for her.

Wild Nights by Emily Dickinson
Wild Nights – Wild Nights!
Were I with thee
Wild Nights should be
Our luxury!

Futile – the winds –
To a heart in port –
Done with the compass –
Done with the chart!

Rowing in Eden –
Ah, the sea!
Might I moor – Tonight –
In thee!

deep love poems for him

Poem to an Unnameable Man by Dorothea Lasky
You have changed me already. I am a fireball
That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball
That is throwing sparks upon your face
Oh look at them shake
Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
O too this is so dramatic this shaking
Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
So you ran and hid
Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think
That tree although soon she will wither
Into ten black snakes upon your throat
And when she does I will be wandering as I always am
A graceful lady that is part museum
Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
I will hold your voice in a little box
And when you come upon me I won’t look back at you
You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back
Into the heart from where it came from
And I will not cry also
Although you will expect me to
I was wiser too than you had expected
For I knew all along you were mine

romantic poems for him to make him cry

To My Dear and Loving Husband by Anne Bradstreet
If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.

Poem for My Love by June Jordan
How do we come to be here next to each other
in the night
Where are the stars that show us to our love
inevitable
Outside the leaves flame usual in darkness
and the rain
falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh
the black men waiting on the corner for
a womanly mirage
I am amazed by peace
It is this possibility of you
asleep
and breathing in the quiet air

most beautiful love poems for him

I Love You by Ella Wheeler Wilcox
I love your lips when they’re wet with wine
And red with a wild desire;
I love your eyes when the lovelight lies
Lit with a passionate fire.
I love your arms when the warm white flesh
Touches mine in a fond embrace;
I love your hair when the strands enmesh
Your kisses against my face.

Not for me the cold, calm kiss
Of a virgin’s bloodless love;
Not for me the saint’s white bliss,
Nor the heart of a spotless dove.
But give me the love that so freely gives
And laughs at the whole world’s blame,
With your body so young and warm in my arms,
It sets my poor heart aflame.

So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,
Still fragrant with ruby wine,
And say with a fervor born of the South
That your body and soul are mine.
Clasp me close in your warm young arms,
While the pale stars shine above,
And we’ll live our whole young lives away
In the joys of a living love.

deep passionate love poems for him

Remember by Christina Rossetti
Remember me when I am gone away,
Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann’d:
Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad.

Love And Friendship by Emily Bronte
Love is like the wild rose-briar,
Friendship like the holly-tree—
The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
But which will bloom most constantly?

The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,
Its summer blossoms scent the air;
Yet wait till winter comes again
And who will call the wild-briar fair?

Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
And deck thee with the holly’s sheen,
That when December blights thy brow
He still may leave thy garland green.

sweet love poems for him that will make him cry

Love by Margaret Atwood
This is a word we use to plug
holes with. It’s the right size for those warm
blanks in speech, for those red heart-
shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing
like real hearts. Add lace
and you can sell
it. We insert it also in the one empty
space on the printed form
that comes with no instructions. There are whole
magazines with not much in them
but the word love, you can
rub it all over your body and you
can cook with it too. How do we know
it isn’t what goes on at the cool
debaucheries of slugs under damp
pieces of cardboard? As for the weed-
seedlings nosing their tough snouts up
among the lettuces, they shout it.
Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raising
their glittering knives in salute.

Then there’s the two
of us. This word
is far too short for us, it has only
four letters, too sparse
to fill those deep bare
vacuums between the stars
that press on us with their deafness.
It’s not love we don’t wish
to fall into, but that fear.
this word is not enough but it will
have to do. It’s a single
vowel in this metallic
silence, a mouth that says
O again and again in wonder
and pain, a breath, a finger
grip on a cliffside. You can
hold on or let go.

short deep love poems for him

The Meeting by Katherine Mansfield
We started speaking,
Looked at each other, then turned away.
The tears kept rising to my eyes.
But I could not weep.
I wanted to take your hand
But my hand trembled.
You kept counting the days
Before we should meet again.
But both of us felt in our hearts
That we parted for ever and ever.
The ticking of the little clock filled the quiet room.
“Listen,” I said. “It is so loud,
Like a horse galloping on a lonely road,
As loud as a horse galloping past in the night.”
You shut me up in your arms.
But the sound of the clock stifled our hearts’ beating.
You said, “I cannot go: all that is living of me
Is here for ever and ever.”
Then you went.
The world changed. The sound of the clock grew fainter,
Dwindled away, became a minute thing.
I whispered in the darkness. “If it stops, I shall die.”

The Kiss by Sara Teasdale
I hoped that he would love me,
And he has kissed my mouth,
But I am like a stricken bird
That cannot reach the south.

For though I know he loves me,
To-night my heart is sad;
His kiss was not so wonderful
As all the dreams I had.

Famously Gorgeous Love Poems For Him The-Kiss-by-Sara-Teasdale

At Last by Elizabeth Akers Allen
At last, when all the summer shine
That warmed life’s early hours is past,
Your loving fingers seek for mine
And hold them close–at last–at last!
Not oft the robin comes to build
Its nest upon the leafless bough
By autumn robbed, by winter chilled,–
But you, dear heart, you love me now.

Though there are shadows on my brow
And furrows on my cheek, in truth,–
The marks where Time’s remorseless plough
Broke up the blooming sward of Youth,–
Though fled is every girlish grace
Might win or hold a lover’s vow,
Despite my sad and faded face,
And darkened heart, you love me now!

I count no more my wasted tears;
They left no echo of their fall;
I mourn no more my lonesome years;
This blessed hour atones for all.
I fear not all that Time or Fate
May bring to burden heart or brow,–
Strong in the love that came so late,
Our souls shall keep it always now!

love poems for him that will make him cry

Maud by Alfred, Lord Tennyson
A Monodrama
Come into the garden, Maud,
For the black bat, night, has flown,
Come into the garden, Maud,
I am here at the gate alone;
And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,
And the musk of the rose is blown.

For a breeze of morning moves,
And the planet of Love is on high,
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves
In a bed of daffodil sky,
To faint in the light of the sun she loves,
To faint in his light, and to die.

All night have the roses heard
The flute, violin, bassoon;
All night has the casement jessamine stirr’d
To the dancers dancing in tune;
Till a silence fell with the waking bird,
And a hush with the setting moon.

I said to the lily, “There is but one
With whom she has heart to be gay.
When will the dancers leave her alone?
She is weary of dance and play.”
Now half to the setting moon are gone,
And half to the rising day;
Low on the sand and loud on the stone
The last wheel echoes away.

I said to the rose, “The brief night goes
In babble and revel and wine.
O young lord-lover, what sighs are those,
For one that will never be thine?
But mine, but mine,” so I sware to the rose,
“For ever and ever, mine.”

And the soul of the rose went into my blood,
As the music clash’d in the hall;
And long by the garden lake I stood,
For I heard your rivulet fall
From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,
Our wood, that is dearer than all;

From the meadow your walks have left so sweet
That whenever a March-wind sighs
He sets the jewel-print of your feet
In violets blue as your eyes,
To the woody hollows in which we meet
And the valleys of Paradise.

The slender acacia would not shake
One long milk-bloom on the tree;
The white lake-blossom fell into the lake
As the pimpernel dozed on the lea;
But the rose was awake all night for your sake,
Knowing your promise to me;
The lilies and roses were all awake,
They sigh’d for the dawn and thee.

Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls,
Come hither, the dances are done,
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
Queen lily and rose in one;
Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls,
To the flowers, and be their sun.

There has fallen a splendid tear
From the passion-flower at the gate.
She is coming, my dove, my dear;
She is coming, my life, my fate;
The red rose cries, “She is near, she is near;”
And the white rose weeps, “She is late;”
The larkspur listens, “I hear, I hear;”
And the lily whispers, “I wait.”

She is coming, my own, my sweet;
Were it ever so airy a tread,
My heart would hear her and beat,
Were it earth in an earthy bed;
My dust would hear her and beat,
Had I lain for a century dead,
Would start and tremble under her feet,
And blossom in purple and red.

Busy old fool, unruly sun,
               Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
               Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
               Late school boys and sour prentices,
         Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
         Call country ants to harvest offices,
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.

               Thy beams, so reverend and strong
               Why shouldst thou think?
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,
But that I would not lose her sight so long;
               If her eyes have not blinded thine,
               Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine
         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.

               She's all states, and all princes, I,
               Nothing else is.
Princes do but play us; compared to this,
All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
               Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
               In that the world's contracted thus.
         Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
         To warm the world, that's done in warming us.
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.



Body of a Woman 


Body of a woman, white hills, white thighs, 
you look like a world, lying in surrender. 

My rough peasant's body digs into you 

and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth. 

I was alone like a tunnel. The birds fled from me, 
and night swamped me with its crushing invasion. 

To survive myself I forged you like a weapon, 
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling. 

But the hour of vengeance falls, and a love you. 

Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk. 

Oh the goblets of the breast! Oh the eyes of absence! 

Oh the pink roses of the pubis! Oh your voice, slow and 
sad ! 

Body of my woman, I will persist in your grace. 

My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road! 

Dark River-beds where the eternal thirst flows 
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache. 



II 


The Light Wraps You 


The light wraps you in its mortal flame. 

Abstracted pale mourner, standing that way 
against the old propellers of twilight 
that revolves around you. 

Speechless, my friend, 

alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead 
and filled with lives of fire, 
and pure heir of the ruined day. 

A bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment. 
The great roots of night 
grow suddenly from your soul, 

and the things that hide in you come out again 
so that a blue and pallid people, 
your newly born, takes nourishment. 

Oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave 

of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold: 

rise, lead and possess a creation 

so rich in life that its flowers perish 

and it is full of sadness. 



Ill 


Ah Vastness of Pines 


Ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking, 
slow play of lights, solitary bell, 
twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll, 
earth-shell, in whom the earth sings! 


I n you 
as you 
Aim my 
and in 


the rivers sing and my soul flees in them 
desire, and you send it where you will, 
road on your bow of hope 

a frenzy I will flee my flock of arrows. 


On all sides I see your waist of fog, 
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours; 
my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests 
in your arms of transparent stone. 


Ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens 
in the resonant and dying evening! 

Thus in the deep hours I have seen, over the fields, 
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind. 



IV 


The Morning Is Full 


The morning is full of storm 
in the heart of summer. 

The clouds travel like white handkerchiefs of goodbye, the 
wind, traveling, waving them in its hands. 

The numberless heart of the wind 
beating above our loving silence. 

Orchestral and divine, resounding among the trees 
like a language full of wars and songs. 

Wind that bears off the dead leaves with a quick raid and 
deflects the pulsing arrows of the birds. 

Wind that topples her in a wave without spray 
and substance without weight, and leaning fires. 

Her mass of kisses breaks and sinks, 
assailed in the door of the summer's wind. 



V 


So That You Will Hear Me 


So that you will hear me 
my words 

sometimes grow thin 

as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches. 

Necklace, drunken bell 

for your hands as smooth as grapes. 

And I watch my words from a long way off. 

They are more yours than mine. 

They climb on my old suffering ivy. 

It climbs the same way on damp walls. 

You are to blame for this cruel sport. 

They are fleeing from my dark lair. 

You fill everything, you fill everything. 

Before you they are peopled in the solitude that you occupy, 
and they are more used to my sadness than you are. 

Now I want them to say what I want to say to you 
and to make you hear as I wasn't you to hear me. 

The winds of anguish still hauls on them as usual. 

Sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over. 

You listen to other voices in my painful voice 

Lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications. 

Love me, companion. Don't forsake me. Follow me. 

Follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish. 

But my words become stained with your love. 

You occupy everything, you occupy everything. 

I am making them into an endless necklace 
for your white hands, smooth as grapes. 



VI 


I Remember You As You Were 


I remember you as you were last autumn. 

You were the grey beret and the still heart. 

In your eyes the flames of twilight fought on. 

And the leaves fell on the water of your soul. 

Clasping my arms like a climbing plant 

the leaves garnered your voice, that was slow and at peace. 
Bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning. 

Sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul. 

I feel your eyes traveling, and the autumn is far off: grey 
beret, voice of bird, heart like a house, 
towards which my deep longings migrated 
and my kisses fell, happy as embers. 

Sky from a ship. Field from the hills: 

Your memory is made of light, of smoke, of a still pond! 
Beyond your eyes, farther on, the evenings were blazing. 

Dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul. 



VII 


Leaning Into The Afternoons 


Leaning into the afternoons I cast my sad nets 
towards your oceanic eyes. 

There in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames, 
its arms turning like a drowning man's. 

I sent out red signals across your absent eyes 
that move like the sea near a lighthouse. 

You keep only darkness, my distant female, 

from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges. 

Leaning into the afternoons I fling my sad nets 
to the sea that beats on your marine eyes. 

The birds peck at the first stars 

that flash like my soul when I love you. 

The night on its shadowy mare 
shedding blue tassels over the land. 



VIII 


White Bee 


White bee, you buzz in my soul, drunk with honey, 
and your flight winds in slow spirals of smoke. 

I am the one without hope, the word without echoes, 
he who lost everything and he who had everything. 

Last hawser, in you creaks my last longing. 

In my barren land you are the final rose. 

Ah you who are silent! 

Let your deep eyes close. There the night flutters. 

Ah your body, a frightened statue, naked. 

You have deep eyes in which the night flails. 

Cool arms of flowers and a lap of rose. 

Your breasts seem like white snails. 

A butterfly of shadow has come to sleep in your belly. 

Ah you who are silent! 

Here is the solitude from which you are absent. 

It is raining. The sea wind is hunting stray gulls. 

The water walks barefoot in the wet streets. 

From that tree the leaves complain as though they were sick. 

White bee, even when you are gone you buzz in my soul 
You live again in time, slender and silent. 

Ah you who are silent! 



IX 


Drunk With Pines 


Drunk with pines and long kisses, 
like summer I steer the fast sail of roses, 
bent towards the death of the thin day, 
stuck into my solid marine madness. 

Pale and lashed to my ravenous water, 

I cruise in the sour smell of the naked climate, 
still dressed in grey and bitter sounds 
and a sad crest of abandoned spray. 

Hardened by passions, I go mounted on my one wave, 
lunar, solar, burning and cold, all at once, 
becalmed in the throat of fortunate isles 
that are white and sweet as cool hips. 

In the moist night my garment of kisses trembles 
charged to insanity with electric currents, 
heroically dividing into dreams 
and intoxicating roses practising on me. 

Upstream, in the midst of the outer waves, 
your parallel body yields to my arms 
like a fish infinitely fastened to my soul, 
quick and slow, in the energy under the sky.

We Have Lost Even 


We have lost even this twilight. 

No one saw us this evening hand in hand 
while the blue night dropped out of the world. 

I have seen from my window 

the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops. 

Sometimes a piece of sun 

burned like a coin between my hands. 

I remembered you with my soul clenched 
in the sadness of mine that you know. 

Where were you then? 

Who else was there? 

Saying what? 

Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly 
when I have sad and feel you are far away? 

The book fell that is always turned to at twilight 
and my cape rolled like a hurt dog at my feet. 

Always, always you recede through the evenings 
towards where the twilight goes erasing statues. 



XI 


Almost Out of Sky 


Almost out of the sky, half of the moon 
anchors between two mountains. 

Turning, wandering night, the digger of eyes. 
Let's see how many stars are smashed in the pool. 


It makes a cross of mourning between my eyes, and runs away. 
Forge of blue metals, nights of stilled combats, 
my heart revolves like a crazy wheel. 

Girl who have from so far, brought me so far, 
sometimes you glance flashes out under the sky. 

Rumbling, storm, cyclone of fury, 

you cross above my heart without stopping. 

Wind from the tombs carries off, wrecks, scatters your 
sleepy root . 


The big trees on the other side of her, uprooted. 

But you, cloudless girl, question of smoke, corn tassel. 

You were what the wind was making with illuminated leaves. 
Behind the nocturnal mountains, white lily of conflagration, 
ah, I can say nothing! You were made of everything. 


Longing that sliced my breast into pieces, 

it is time to take another road, on which she does not 

smile . 


Storm that buried the bells, muddy swirl of torments, 
why touch her now, why make her sad. 

Oh to follow the road that leads away from everything, 
without anguish, death, winter waiting along it 
with their eyes open through the dew. 



XII 


Your Breast Is Enough 


Your breast is enough for my heart, 
and my wings for your freedom. 

What was sleeping above your soul will rise 
out of my mouth to heaven. 

In you is the illusion of each day. 

You arrive like the dew to the cupped flowers. 

You undermine the horizon with your absence. 
Eternally in flight like the wave. 

I have said that you sang in the wind 
like the pines and like the masts. 

Like them you are tall and taciturn, 

and you are sad, all at once, like a voyage. 

You gather things to you like an old road. 

You are peopled with echoes and nostalgic voices. 
I awoke and at times the birds fled and migrated 
that had been sleeping in your soul. 



XIII 


I Have Gone Marking 


I have gone marking the atlas of your body 
with crosses of fire. 

My mouth went across: a spider trying to hide. 

In you, behind you, timid, driven by thirst. 

Stories to tell you on the shore of the evening, 
sad and gentle doll, so that you should not be sad. 

A swan, a tree, something far away and happy. 

The season of grapes, the ripe and fruitful season. 

I who lived in a harbour from which I loved you. 

The solitude crossed with dream and with silence. 

Penned up between the sea and sadness. 

Soundless, delirious, between two motionless gondoliers. 

Between the lips and the voice something goes dying. 
Something with the wings of a bird, something of anguish and 
oblivion . 

The way nets cannot hold water. 

My toy doll, only a few drops are left trembling. 

Even so, something sings in these fugitive words. 

Something sings, something climbs to my ravenous mouth. 

Oh to be able to celebrate you with all the words of joy. 

Sing, burn, flee, like a belfry at the hands of a madman. 

My sad tenderness, what comes over you all at once? 

When I have reached the most awesome and the coldest summit 
my heart closes like a nocturnal flower. 



XIV 


Every Day You Play 


Every day you play with the light of the universe. 

Subtle visitor, you arrive in the flower and the water. 

You are more that this white head that I hold tightly 
as a cluster of fruit, every day, between my hands. 

You are like nobody since I love you. 

Let me spread you out among the yellow garlands. 

Who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of 
the south? 

Oh let me remember you as you were before you existed. 


Suddenly the wind howls and bangs my shut window. 

The sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish. 

Here all the winds will let go sooner or later, all of them. 
The rain takes off her clothes. 

The birds go by, fleeing. 

The wind. The wind. 

I can contend only against the power of men. 

The storm whirls dark leaves 

and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to 
the sky. 

You are here. Oh you do not run away. 

You will answer me to the last cry. 

Cling to me as though you were frightened. 

Even so, at one time a strange shadow ran through your eyes. 

Now, now too, little one, you bring me honeysuckle, 
and even your breasts smell of it. 

While the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies 
I love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth. 

How you must have suffered against getting accustomed to me, 
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all 
running . 

So many times have we seen the morning star burn, kissing 
our eyes, 

and over our heads the grey light unwind in turning fans. 

My words rained over you, stroking you. 



A long time I have loved the sunned mother-of-pearl of your 
body . 

I go so far as to think you own the universe. 

I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, 
bluebells, 

dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses. 

I want 

to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees. 



XV 


I Like For You To Be Still 


I like for you to be still: I as though you were absent, 
and you do not hear me far away and my voice does not touch 
you . 

It seems as though your eyes had flown away 
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth 

As all things are filled with my soul 

you emerge from the things, filled with my soul. 

You are like my soul, a butterfly of dream, 
and you are like the word Melancholy. 

I like for you to be still, and you are still far away. 

It sounds as though you were lamenting, a butterfly cooing 
like a dove . 

And you hear me from far away, and my voice does not reach 
you : 

Let me come to be still in you silence. 

And let me talk to you with your silence 
that is bright as a lamp, simple as a ring. 

You are like the night, with its stillness and 
constellations . 

Your silence is that of a star, as remote and candid. 

I like for you to be still: it is though you were absent, 
distant and full of sorrow as though you had died. 

One word then, one smile, is enough. 

And I am happy, happy that it's not true. 



XVI 


In My Sky As Twilight 


In my sky at twilight you are like a cloud 

and your form and colour are the way I love them. 

You are mine, mine, woman with sweet lips 
and in your life my infinite dreams live. 

The lamp of my soul dyes your feet. 

My sour wine is sweeter than your lips, 

oh reaper of my evening song, 

how solitary dreams believe you to be mine! 

You are mine, mine, I go shouting it to the afternoon' 
wind, and the wind hauls on my widowed voice. 

Huntress of the depths of my eyes, your plunder 
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water. 

You are taken in the net of my music, my love, 
and my nets of music are wide as the sky. 

My soul is borne on the shore of your eyes of mourning 
In your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begins. 



XVII 


Thinking, Tangling Shadows 


Thinking , tangling shadows in the deep solitude. 

You are far away too, oh farther than anyone. 

Thinking, freeing birds, dissolving images, 
burying lamps. 

Belfry of fogs, how far away, up there! 

Stifling laments, milling shadowy hopes, 
taciturn miller, 

night falls on you face downward, far from the city. 

Your presence is foreign, as strange as a thing. 

I think, I explore great tracts of my life before you. 
My life before anyone, my harsh life. 

The shout facing the sea, among the rocks, 
running free, mad, in the sea-spray. 

The sad rage, the shout, the solitude of the sea. 
Headlong, violent, stretched towards the sky. 

You, woman, what were you there, what ray, what vane 
of that immense fan? You were as far as you are now. 
Fire in the forest! Burn in blue crosses. 

Burn, burn, flame up, sparkle in trees of light. 

It collapses, crackling. Fire. Fire. 

And my soul dances, seared with curls of fire. 

Who calls? What silence peopled with echoes? 

Hour of nostalgia, hour of happiness, hour of solitude, 
hour that is mine from among them all! 

Hunting horn through which the wind passes singing. 

Such a passion of weeping tied to my body. 

Shaking of all the roots, 
attack of all the waves! 

My soul wandered, happy, sad, unending. 

Thinking, burying lamps in the deep solitude. 


Who are you, who are you? 



XVIII 


Here I Love You 


Here I love you. 

In the dark pines the wind disentangles itself. 

The moon glows like phosphorus on the vagrant waters. 
Days, all one kind, go chasing each other. 

The snow unfurls in dancing figures. 

A silver gull slips down from the west. 

Sometimes a sail. High, high stars. 

Oh the black cross of a ship. 

Alone . 

Sometimes I get up early and my soul is wet. 

Far away the sea sounds and resounds. 

This is a port . 

Here I love you. 

Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain. 

I love you still among these cold things. 

Sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels 
that cross the sea towards no arrival. 

I see myself forgotten like those old anchors. 

The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there. 

My life grows tired, hungry to no purpose. 

I love what I do not have. You are so far. 

My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights. 

But night comes on and starts to sing to me. 

The moon turns its clockwork dream. 

The biggest stars look at me with your eyes. 

And as I love you, the pines in the wind 

want to sing your name with their leaves of wire. 



XIX 


Girl Lithe and Tawny 


Girl lithe and tawny, the sun that forms 

the fruits, that plumps the grains, that curls seaweeds 
filled your body with joy, and your luminous eyes 
and your mouth that has the smile of water. 

A black yearning sun is braided into the strands 
of your black mane, when you stretch your arms. 

You play with the sun as with a little brook 
and it leaves two dark pools in your eyes. 

Girl lithe and tawny, nothing draws me towards you. 
Everything bears me farther away, as though you were noon. 
You are the frenzied youth of the bee, 

the drunkenness of the wave, the power of the wheat-ear. 

My somber heart searches for you, nevertheless, 

and I love your joyful body, your slender and flowing voice. 

Dark butterfly, sweet and definitive 

like the wheat-field and the sun, the poppy and the water. 



XX 


Tonight I Can Write 


Tonight I can write the saddest lines. 

Write, for example, "The night is starry 

and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance." 

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings. 

Tonight I can write the saddest lines. 

I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. 

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms. 

I kissed her again and again under the endless sky. 

She loved me, and sometimes I loved her too. 

How could I not have loved her great still eyes. 

Tonight I can write the saddest lines. 

To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost 
her . 

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her. 
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture. 

What does it matter that my love could not keep her. 

The night is starry and she is not with me. 

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the 
distance . 

My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. 

My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer 
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me. 

The same night whitening the same trees. 

We, of that time, are no longer the same. 

I no longer love her, that's for certain, but how I loved 
her . 

My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing. 
Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my 



kisses . 

Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes. 

I am no longer in love with her, that's certain, but maybe I 
love her . 

Love is so short, forgetting is so long. 

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms 
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. 

Though this be the last pain she makes me suffer 
and these the last verses that I write for her. 



The Song of Despair 


The memory of you emerges from the night around me. 

The river mingles in its stubborn lament with the sea. 

Deserted like the wharves at dawn. 

It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! 

Cold flower heads are raining in my heart. 

Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked. 

In you the wars and the flights accumulated 
From you the wings of the song birds rose. 

You swallowed everything, like distance. 

Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! 

It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss. 

The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse. 

Pilot's dread, fury of a blind driver, 

turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank. 

In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded. 
Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! 

You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire, 
sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! 

I made the wall of shadow draw back, 
beyond desire and act, I walked on. 

Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman that I loved and lost, 

I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you. 

Like a jar you housed the infinite tenderness 

and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar. 

There was the black solitude of the islands, 
and there, woman of love, your arms took me in. 

There were thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit. 
There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle. 

Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me 
in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! 

How horrible and brief was my desire of you! 



How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid. 

Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs, 
still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds. 

Oh the bitter mouth, oh the kissed limbs, 
oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies. 

Oh the mad coupling of hope and force 
in which we merged and despaired. 

And the tenderness, light as water and as flour. 

And the word scarcely begun on the lips. 

This was my destiny and in it was the voyage of my longing, 
and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank. 

Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you, 

what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not 
drowned ! 

From billow to billow you still called and sang. 

Standing like a sailor on the prow of the vessel. 

You still flowered in songs, you still broke in currents. 

Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well. 

Pale blind diver, luckless slinger, 
lost discoverer, in you everything sank! 

It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour 
in which the night fastens to all timetables. 

The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore. 

Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate. 

Deserted like the wharves at dawn. 

Only the tremulous shadow twists in my hands. 

Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything. 

It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!





















It was many and many a year ago, 
   In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   By the name of Annabel Lee; 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   Than to love and be loved by me. 

I was a child and she was a child, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
But we loved with a love that was more than love— 
   I and my Annabel Lee— 
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven 
   Coveted her and me. 

And this was the reason that, long ago, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
   My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
So that her highborn kinsmen came 
   And bore her away from me, 
To shut her up in a sepulchre 
   In this kingdom by the sea. 

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
   Went envying her and me— 
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, 
   In this kingdom by the sea) 
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. 

But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
   Of those who were older than we— 
   Of many far wiser than we— 
And neither the angels in Heaven above 
   Nor the demons down under the sea 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, 
   In her sepulchre there by the sea— 
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.
