 they adored each other but there was no sexual thing said daughter maria 
 they were buddies they were friends they were comrades in arms 
 
 truth is so great that i like to speak or sleep or listen or love 
 to feel myself trapped with no fear of blood outside time and magic within your own fear and your great anguish and within the very beating of your heart 
 all this madness if i asked it of you i know in your silence there would be only confusion 
 i ask you for violence in the nonsense and you you give me grace your light and your warmth 
 like to paint you but there are no colors because there are so many in my confusion the tangible form of my great love 
 f
 nothing compares to your hands nothing like the of your eyes 
 my body is filled with you for days and days 
 you are the mirror of the night 
 the violent flash of lightning 
 the dampness of the earth 
 the hollow of your armpits is my shelter 
 my fingers touch your blood 
 all my joy is to feel life spring from your that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours 
 
 
 she who wears the color 
 he who sees the color 
 since the year 
 until always and forever 
 now in 
 after all the hours lived through 
 the vectors continue in their original direction 
 nothing stops them 
 with no more knowledge than live emotion 
 with no other wish than to go on until they meet 
 slowly 
 with great unease but with the certainty that all is guided by the golden section 
 there is cellular arrangement 
 there is movement 
 there is light 
 all centers are the same 
 folly exist 
 we are the same as we were and as we will be 
 not counting on idiotic destiny 
 my mirror of the night your eyes green swords inside my flesh 
 waves between our hands 
 all of you in a space full of sounds in the shade and in the light 
 you were called the one who captures color 
 i the one who gives color 
 you are all the combinations of numbers 
 life 
 my wish is to understand lines form shades movement 
 you fulfill and i receive 
 your word travels the entirety of space and reaches my cells which are my stars then goes to yours which are my light 
 belongs to the last generation of devoted letter writers 
 she took immense pleasure in the act often writing to authors when there was no obvious necessity of doing so except for the necessity of keeping a channel open to them 
 although she naturally did much of her editorial work with local authors in person or by phone she also sent long funny perceptive letters to those with whom she had just spoken by telephone or just that day met for lunch 
 time and again she simply could not resist the temptation to write 
 dear we had your letter this morning 
 i will answer it from my point of view and of course will from hers 
 first if you are in love a good thing about the best thing that can happen to anyone 
 let anyone make it small or light to you 
 second there are several kinds of love 
 one is a selfish mean grasping thing which uses love for 
 this is the ugly and crippling kind 
 the other is an outpouring of everything good in you of kindness and consideration and respect not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable 
 the first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength and courage and goodness and even wisdom you know you had 
 you say this is not puppy love 
 if you feel so deeply of course it puppy love 
 but i think you were asking me what you feel 
 you know better than anyone 
 what you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it and that i can tell you 
 glory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it 
 the object of love is the best and most beautiful 
 try to live up to it 
 if you love someone there is no possible harm in saying so only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that into consideration 
 girls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel but they usually like to hear it also 
 it sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good 
 lastly i know your feeling because i have it and glad you have it 
 we will be glad to meet 
 she will be very welcome 
 but will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to 
 she knows about love too and maybe she can give you more help than i can 
 and worry about losing 
 if it is right it happens the main thing is not to hurry 
 nothing good gets away 
 love she was sitting on the floor in her red velvet jacket red striped silk shirt i her pearls into heaps of great clustered eggs 
 she had come up to see me so we go on a spirited creditable affair i think innocent spiritually all gain i think rather a bore for but not enough to worry him 
 the truth is one has room for a good many relationships 
 his is the theory that anything that is art is presumably about some certain thing but is really always about something else and its no good having one without the other because if you just have the something it is boring and if you just have the something else its irritating 
 dear dearest my body is simply crazy with wanting you if you come tomorrow i see how i can wait for you i wonder if your body wants mine the way mine wants yours the kisses the the wetness all melting together the being held so tight that it hurts the and the struggle 
 wanted to write you a note and tell you over the phone that your new ideas for the ending of window seem wonderful to me and sure its going to be a beautiful book 
 keep working on it and when you have all the chapters together you and i can go over it word for word and get down to brass you should forgive the originality of my prose style 
 but the main thing is thanks for everything i am sure you are doing to the book 
 the pages you showed me the other day in the made me very very very happy 
 as for your color pictures for the book words are no good whatsoever 
 there are a few peaks in an editors life and seeing those pictures of yours has been a peak of mine 
 they are lovely and absolutely perfect and well pure in the best sense 
 it was the thirst of many years restrained in our body 
 words which we could not say except on the lips of dreams 
 everything was surrounded by the green miracle of the landscape of your body 
 upon your form the lashes of the flowers responded to my touch the murmur of streams 
 there was all manner of fruits in the juice of your lips the blood of the the horizon of the and the purified pineapple 
 i pressed you against my breast and the prodigy of your form penetrated all my blood through the tips of my fingers 
 smell of oak essence memories of walnut green breath of ash tree 
 horizon and landscapes i traced them with a kiss 
 oblivion of words will form the exact language for understanding the glances of our closed eyes 
 you are here intangible and you are all the universe which i shape into the space of my room 
 your absence springs trembling in the ticking of the clock in the pulse of light you breathe through the mirror 
 from you to my hands i caress your entire body and i am with you for a minute and i am with myself for a moment 
 and my blood is the miracle which runs in the vessels of the air from my heart to yours 
 the green miracle of the landscape of my body becomes in your the whole of nature 
 i fly through it to caress the rounded hills with my fingertips my hands sink into the shadowy valleys in an urge to possess and in the embrace of gentle branches green and cool 
 i penetrate the sex of the whole earth her heat me and my entire body is rubbed by the freshness of the tender leaves 
 their dew is the sweat of an lover 
 its not love or tenderness or affection its life itself my life that i found what i saw it in your hands in your month and in your breasts 
 i have the taste of almonds from your lips in my mouth 
 our worlds have never gone outside 
 only one mountain can know the core of another mountain 
 your presence floats for a moment or two as if wrapping my whole being in an anxious wait for the morning 
 i notice that with you 
 at that instant still full of sensations my hands are sunk in oranges and my body feels surrounded by your arms 
 for my the silent life giver of worlds what is most important is the 
 morning breaks the friendly reds the big blues hands full of leaves noisy birds fingers in the hair pigeons nests a rare understanding of human struggle simplicity of the senseless song the folly of the wind in my heart let them rhyme girl sweet chocolate of ancient storm in the blood that comes in through the mouth omen laughter and sheer teeth needles of pearl for some gift on a seventh of i ask for it i get it i sing sang ill sing from now on our magic love 
 since i left you i have been constantly depressed 
 my happiness is to be near you 
 incessantly i live over in my memory your caresses your tears your affectionate solicitude 
 the charms of the incomparable continually a burning and a glowing flame in my heart 
 when free from all solicitude all harassing care shall i be able to pass all my time with you having only to love you and to think only of the happiness of so saying and of proving it to you a precious mouldering pleasure t is to meet an antique book in just the dress his century wore a privilege i think his venerable hand to take and warming in our own a passage back or two to make to times when he was young 
 his quaint opinions to inspect his knowledge to unfold on what concerns our mutual mind the literature of old what interested scholars most what ran when was a certainty 
 and a man when was a living girl and wore the gown that 
 facts centuries before he familiar as one should come to town and tell you all your dreams were true he lived where dreams were sown 
 his presence is enchantment you beg him not to go old volumes shake their vellum heads and just so 
 success 
 published in a of poets at the request of h

 the authors and friend 
 success is counted sweetest by those who succeed 
 to comprehend a nectar requires sorest need 
 not one of all the purple host who took the flag today can tell the definition so clear of victory as he defeated dying on whose forbidden ear the distant strains of triumph break agonized and clear all trials are trials for ones life just as all sentences are sentences of death and three times i have been tried 
 the first time i left the box to be arrested the second time to be led back to the house of detention and the third time to pass into prison for two years 
 society as we have constituted it will have no place for me has none to offer but nature whose sweet rains fall on just and unjust alike will have clefts in the rocks where i may hide and secret valleys in whose silence i may weep undisturbed 
 she will hang with stars so that i may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling and send the wind over my so that none may track me to my hurt she will me in great waters and with bitter herbs make me whole your letter from came this why do you think i feel or that i make phrases lovely phrases you say which rob things of reality 
 just the opposite 
 always always always i try to say what i feel 
 will you then believe that after you went last a week i went into the slums of to find a barrel organ 
 but it did not make me cheerful and ever since nothing important has its dull and damp 
 i have been dull i have missed you 
 i do miss you 
 i shall miss you 
 and if you believe it a owl and ass 
 lovely phrases but of course to return to your letter i always knew about your 
 only i said to myself i insist upon kindness 
 with this aim in view i came to long barn 
 open the top button of your jersey and you will see nestling inside a lively squirrel with the most inquisitive habits but a dear creature all the same i am reduced to a thing that wants 
 i composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night and it has all gone i just miss you in a quite simple desperate human way 
 you with all your letters would never write so elementary phrase as that perhaps you even feel it 
 and yet i believe be sensible of a little gap 
 but clothe it in so exquisite a phrase that it would lose a little of its reality 
 whereas with me it is quite stark i miss you even more than i could have believed and i was prepared to miss you a good deal 
 so this letter is just really a squeal of pain 
 it is incredible how essential to me you have become 
 i suppose you are accustomed to people saying these things 
 damn you creature i make you love me any the more by giving myself away like oh my dear i cant be clever and with you i love you too much for that 
 too truly 
 you have no idea how i can be with people i love 
 i have brought it to a fine art 
 but you have broken down my 
 and i really resent it please forgive me for writing such a miserable letter

 was doomed 
 had come swooped upon it it and was gone leaving the treacherous isle a desolate heap of smoking ashes in the leaden sea while onward all those pirate plunged into the golden west across the broad once again i will show said that henceforth will sail old ocean where will 
 onward they surged and the great glittering crested majestic waves rushed up to meet the and there was around them but the ruin and roar of the huge seas grey mounded seas pursuing and pursued that and on for ever from empty to of the grey sky 
 over the wandering wilderness of foam 
 onward through storm and death swept for no once more a fell plague gripped the tossing ships and not by twos and threes as heretofore his crews were but in three black days three hundred seamen in their were cast into the deep 
 onward he swept having in mind to strike in the throat at st
 port of a city of far renown a jewel on the shores of old romance with immortal gold queen city of over sea and guarded by great guns 
 out of the the pirate ships came leaping grim and black and ere the were awake the flag of floated from their topmost tower 
 but since he had not troops enough to hold so great a city entrenched his men within the and held the batteries 
 thence he demanded ransom and sent out a boy with flag of truce 
 the boys return waited long 
 under a palm he stood watching the enemies camp and lo along the hot white road him a crawling shape writhed through the dust up to his feet a shape with blood a shape that held the stumps up of its wrists and moaned an thing a naked rag of flesh mangled a small face hideously puckered like a monkeys with lips drawn backward from its teeth 
 speak speak 
 in gods name speak what art thou whispered and a sharp cry came answering his dread a cry as of a in the wind astray from all shores captain i am thy boy only thy boy see see my captain see what they have done captain i only bore the flag i only lad lad lad moaned and stooping strove to pillow the mangled head upon his arm 
 what have they done to thee what have they done and at the touch the boy screamed once and died 
 then like a savage sea with arms uplift to heaven the wrath of blazed eternal god be this the doom of have no pity 
 send the strength of thy great seas into my soul that i may devastate this empire this red hell they make of thy good earth 
 his men drew round 
 staring in horror at the silent shape that daubed his feet 
 like a cold wind his words went through their flesh this is the that bore our flag of truce 
 this hath done 
 look well upon it draw the smoke of the blood up into your nostrils my companions and down into your souls 
 this makes an end for bring forth the prisoners and let me look on them 
 forth they were brought a swarthy gorgeous band of soldiers priests and sailors hedged between sturdy files of naked 
 close up to they halted under the palm gay smiling prisoners for they thought their friends had them 
 then they looked up and met a glance that swept them like a sword making the blood strain back from their faces into their quivering hearts with unknown dread as that pointed to the shape before his feet 
 dogs will ye lap his blood before ye die make haste for it cold ye will not will not even your hands in that red puddle of flesh what are ye come come ill look at you perchance one but a and holds you back 
 and with the word stepped among their ranks and read each face among the swarthy crew the gorgeous soldiers sailors priests with and cross a slender page in scarlet a cloud of golden hair and two 
 the slim page drew before the throng 
 you are young he said go take this message to the camp of tell them i have a hunger in my soul to look upon the murderers of this boy 
 to see what eyes they have what manner of mouths 
 to touch them and to take their hands in mine and draw them close to me and upon them until they know my soul as i know theirs and they grovel in the dust and grope for mercy 
 say that until i get them every day ill hang two though i the main 
 tell them that every day ill bum a portion of their city down then find another city and burn that 
 and then bum others till i burn away their empire from the world till i reach the imperial throne of with my fires and send it shrieking down to burn in hell for ever 
 go then turned once again to face the prisoners 
 with a voice cold as the utterance of fate his grim command went forth 
 now begin with yon two in whose faces like singed swine and eyed with the spent coals of filthy living the glory of 
 strip off their rags and twist their ropes around their throats and hang them high over the camp for all to see 
 at dawn ill choose two more 
 book x across the great rushed as of a mighty wind

 but who shall tell in this cold age the power that he became who drew the universe within his soul and moved with cosmic forces though the deep divided it from the gorgeous court of shuddered away from the streaming coasts as a field of golden wheat 
 the king bidding his guests to a feast in his own ship on that sea was made a mock as one by one his ladies proffered excuse for fear of that beyond 
 round now ballad and story told how in the cabin of there hung a magic glass wherein he saw the fleets of every foe and all that passed aboard them 
 herself perplexed that this proud should prevail 
 fostered a darker dream that had bought like old power to loose or bind the winds at will 
 and now a tale the deep of a distant dawn where the embattled troops of and were met but not in war met in the dawn by his compelling will to offer up a sacrifice 
 yea there between the hosts the hands of herself slaughtered the murderers of the boy who had borne flag of truce offered them up as a and an expiation lest with that dread alchemy of his soul should the dust beneath their feet to one same substance with the lace of pain and them in the eternal fires 
 on rushed across the sea large and one most bitter of all to of how had stood r the governors house at and seen a mighty of the king of whereon was the terrestrial globe and on the globe a mighty steed in act to spring into the heavens and from its mouth streaming like smoke a and on the three words of flame and fury of how and his seamen stood gazing upon it and could not from the to its meaning whereupon a hurricane roar of mirth burst from those bearded lips and that laughter shook the world 
 so while the imperial warrior eyes of watched every hour her vast grow to launch and shatter with one stroke our islands frail fear gripped her still for there came sounds across the heaving sea of secret springs unsealed forces a mustering of deep elemental powers a sound as of the burgeoning of boughs in universal april and dead hearts from their tombs a mighty cry of resurrection surging through the souls of all 
 for now the last wild tale swept like another dawn across the deep and in that dawn men saw the slaves of the mutilated of the mines 
 with gaunt backs and branded scarred and by whip and iron in brute lust for gold saw them at great liberating word burst from their chains erect hands of rapture to the glad new light that then then first began to struggle the clouds and crown all manhood with a sacred crown august a light which though from age to age clouds may obscure it grows and still shall grow 
 until that kingdom come that grand communion that that empire which still draws with every hour that federation that turning of the wasteful strength of war to accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace that gathering up of one loads whereby the weak are strengthened and the strong made stronger in the increasing good of all 
 then suddenly it seemed as he had gone a ship came stealing into sound and was home again but not to rest for scarce had he cast anchor ere the road to rang beneath the flying hoofs that bore his brief to saying we have missed the plate fleet by but twelve hours sail the reason being best known to god 
 no less we have given a cooling to the king of 
 there is a great gap opened which is little to his liking 
 we have the towns of his chief burnt their ships 
 captured great store of gold and precious stones three hundred pieces of artillery 
 the more part brass 
 our loss is heavy indeed 
 under the hand of god eight hundred men 
 three parts of them by sickness

 i pray for her commands and those speed that i may strike again 
 outside the these words were writ once more my queens commands i much desire your servant 
 this terse the read thrice over with the broad cliff of his brow bending among his looks 
 thrice he assayed to steel himself with caution as of old and thrice as a glorious lightning running along and flashing between those simple words he saw the great new power that lay at hand an a power unknown before but dawning now a power that swept all old plots and away like straws the germ of an force newborn that laid the source of might at mercy could that force but grow ere should nip it ere the mighty host that waited in the even now that host of thirty thousand men encamped round under should embark by that invincible to leap at throat thrice he assayed to think of helplessness her ships little and few 
 thrice he to quench with caution the high furnace of his soul which had kindled 
 as he read last rough simple plea i wait my queens commands his deep eyes flashed with glorious tears 
 lie leapt to his feet and cried aloud before my god i am proud i am very proud for sake this is a man to the king of

 at one breath of peril to our island why their swords leapt from their and their went up to split the heavens god save our queen even as he there passed the rushing gleam of torches once again and as they stood silently listening all the winds ran wild with bells and a great cry went up god save our queen ill for some two hundred throats among that thousand whispered eagerly with his eyes on the queens face 
 then seeing it he cried 
 pressing the swift advantage home o madam the heart of now is all on fire we are one people as we have not been in all our history all prepared to die around your throne 
 madam you are beloved as never yet was king or queen she looked at him the tears in her keen eyes glittered and i am very proud she said but if our enemies command the world and we have one small island and no more 


 she ceased and in a strange voice hoarse and low 
 with passion deeper than all speech out no more than the great which makes the enemies coast our frontier now no more than that great empire of the deep rolls from pole to pole washing the world with thunder that great empire whose command this is yours to take 
 hear me my queen this is a dream a new dream but a true for days are dawning on the world than heart of man hath known

 on the sacred seas we shall know they hoist their sails this day by peaceful great gleaming in the perfect god if she but her heritage 
 he ceased and the deep dream of that new realm the sea through all the soul of surged a moment then with splendid eyes that filled with fire of far she cried faith making her a child yet still yea claim it for me a moment there trembling she stood 
 then once again there passed a ru
sh of torches through the gloom without and a great cry god save god save our queen yea go then go she said god speed you now sir not as a but with full powers 
 my without a word bent above her hand and ere she knew it his eyes from the dark flashed farewell and he was gone 
 but ere he leapt to saddle stood at his stirrup muttering ride ride now like hell to for the queen is hard beset and ere ye are out at sea her mood will change 
 the friends of will move earth and the heavens for your recall 
 tempt her with their false of peace though i shall here at your back through thick and thin farewell fire flashed beneath the hoofs and was gone 
 scarce had he vanished in the night than doubt once more assailed the queen 
 the death of had brought against her 
 and himself prime of that death being held in much for it stood as helpless 
 long ere or human power they thought could put to sea a sped to bidding to strike at but keep to the high seas and lo 
 the glittered empty 
 was gone gone though the friends of had poured their gold to thin his ranks and every hour his crews deserted he had laughed let buy next to an honest seaman i love best an honest 
 what more task than teaching brave men seamanship he had filled his ships with soldiers out in the teeth of the gale that raged against him he had driven 
 in vain amid the boisterous laughter of the a dashed in hot pursuit and met a roaring breaker and came back with and all trailing in the foam a tangled mass of wreckage and despair 
 sky swept to stormy sky no sail could live in that great yeast of waves but was gone then once again across the rolling sea great rushed of how he had the port of and had swept along the coast to where the whole lay 
 had snapped up prizes under its very nose and taunted high of striving to draw him out for fight 
 and offering if his course should lie that way to convoy to taunted him so bitterly that for once in the eyes a jest had power to kill for died with the spleen of it since he could not move before the appointed season 
 then there came flying back home the queens old borough and all aghast at temerity for he said this man 
 thrust my head against all 
 bade me follow him into mouths aflame with cannon like the jaws of death i much demurred and straightway clapped me in irons me an officer and of the queen and though my voice was all against it plunged into the pit without me left me with some word that burns and in me still making me fear the man was mad some word of lonely seas a desert island and a mutineer and dead gallows 
 my life was hardly safe with him 
 why he resolved to storm the castle of st
 a castle on a cliff grinning with guns well known the fear but to see him land below it and bid surrender the strongest fort of without a blow they laughed and he with all the fury of turned that cliff to hell itself 
 he sent down to the ships for broken beams masts 
 and piled them up against the outer gates 
 higher and higher and fired them 
 there he stood amid the smoke and flame and 
 this like a common seamen black with soot with blood his naked arms full of great like a giant and roaring like 
 he is mad but did he take it say you yea he took it the mightiest stronghold on the coast of took it and tumbled all its big brass guns clattering over the cliffs into the sea 
 but ye need not raise a cheer so loud it is not warfare 
 a trick a devils then the of a storm that scattered the fleet of to the four winds disturbed the heart of as his ships came straggling into one by one saying they could not find him 
 then at last when the storm burst in its might along our coasts one night of rolling gloom his cannon woke old 
 in he came across the thunder and lightning of the sea with his grim ship of war and close behind a shadow like a mountain or a cloud torn from the of a captured loomed and round her prow a whence as she neared the which many a swung from fist yellowed the sudden crimson of her name flashed the white sea of faces 
 and a shout went that the blanching breakers the heart of the great overhead she the mightiest ship afloat and in her hold the riches of a continent a prize greater than earth had ever known for there not only and pearl like heaped on some wizard coast in that dim hull blazed to the not only gold gleamed though of gold a million would not buy her store but in her cabin lay the charts and secrets of the wild wealth of secrets that splashed wharves with coloured dreams and made her misty streets flame like an eastern city when the sun shatters itself on domes and spills its crimson the silvery palms 
 and of those dreams the far east quest began the first was laid of our great empire and a star began to tremble on the brows of that time can never 
 but now the seas darkened indeed with menace now at the wind of the black approaching wings of crept across deep the storm throbbed their thunderous pulse and ere that moon waned a swift foamed into the sound with word that all the invincible was sail for 
 even now torn a thousand withheld the word for which as for life that he might meet them ere they left their coasts meet them or ever they reached the channel meet them now or too late too late at last his voice beat domi those that blindly her ears chatter of meeting on soil and swiftly she commanded seeing once more the light that burned amid the approaching gloom in deep eyes lord of high of straight to join him at sound 
 plow many ships are wanted she asked him thinking we are few indeed give me but sixteen he said and but four by the mercy of god answer for the out to sea they swept in the teeth of a gale but vainly strove to impart the thought wherewith his mind to win command of the by bursting on the fleets of at once even as they left their ports not as of old to hover in a vain dream of round fifty threatened points of coast but clinging to his order 
 flung out his ships in a loose long straggling line across the channel waiting wary alert 
 but powerless thus as a string of scattered seagulls beating against the storm 
 then flying to meet them a brought terror down the wind with news that she had seen that monstrous host stretching from sky to sky great hulks of doom dragging deaths midnight with them the sea 
 up to in his immortal revenge rushed the foam and the swirling seas his dashed alongside 
 on to the decks the tossing like a very shaking the surf and of the spray from and beard he stood before lord in the and poured his heart out like the sea in passionate wave on wave if yonder fleet once reach the channel hardly the mercy of god saves i would pray with my last breath let us beat up to of them now 
 and handle them before they reach the channel 
 nay but we can not bare the coast cried nor have we stores of powder or food enough my lord said with his great arm there is food enough in yonder ships 
 and powder enough and enough we must re there 
 look look he cried and pointed to the heavens 
 as for a soul that by sheer force of will compels the world to work his bidding so it seemed the wind that blew against them slowly veered 
 the sails quivered the skies revolved 
 a northerly breeze awoke and now behind the ships 
 blew steadily the unseen host of 
 it is the breath of god cried they lie and we may work our will with them 
 signal the word 
 lord and drive down and as a man convinced by heaven itself lord ordered straightway the whole fleet to advance 
 and now indeed as foresaw the lay beyond the dim horizon 
 and helpless in bay 
 at mercy could her fleet but draw nigh enough with its and great guns to 
 nearer nearer league by league the ships of came till lay some seventy leagues 
 then yet once more the wind veered straight against them 
 to remain beating against it idly was to starve and as a man upon the world fails for one moment of exhausted will gathering up his forces as he went for one more supreme effort turned his ship and retreated with the rest 
 there while the ships with all haste and axe and hammer rang one golden eve just as the setting sun began to fringe the clouds with crimson and the waves were one wild riot of fair stood old comrades on the green of playing a game of bowls 
 far off unseen a little struggled and leapt and strove sound as any speckled between the white flakes of the waves 
 a group of their lay stretched on the green gazing with great eyes upon their seamen heroes as like gods with the battles of the world they loomed tossing black bowls like against the rosy west or lounged at ease with faces against that sky laughing while from the neighboring inn mine host white and hurried out with foaming cups of sack and they drank deep tossing their heads back under the golden clouds and their bearded lips 
 the hues that slashed their for the boys bright eyes even as the of cloud or moon revealed the old gods were here rich dusky streaks of from the main that shone but to proclaim these heroes 
 there a boy more bold crept nearer to a hat thrown upon the green and touched the silver plume and felt as if he had touched a of feathery palms beyond a crimson sea 
 another stared at the blue rings of smoke a seaman puffed from a long pipe primed with the strange new herb they had lately found in far 
 but the little ship now plunging into bay none saw 
 when she had anchored and her straining boat had touched the land and the boats crew over the leapt with a shout scarce was there one to heed 
 a seaman smiling swaggered out of the inn swinging in one brown hand a gleaming cage wherein a big green chattered and clung fluttering against the wires 
 a troop of girls with arms linked paused to watch the game of bowls and now they flocked around the cage while one with rosy finger tempted the to bite 
 close overhead a flashed 
 once from an open window soft through leaves not far away a voice floated a voice that flushed the cheek of the voice of bending her glossy head over the frame in a quiet song 
 the song ceased 
 still with in their eyes the schoolboys watched the bowls like roll from the hand of gods along the turf 
 suddenly the green a little cloud of seamen shouting stumbling as they ran drew all eyes on them 
 the game ceased 
 a voice rough with the storms of many an ocean roared the they are in the channel we sighted them a line of we could not see an end of them 
 they stretch from north to south like a great storm of clouds glinting with guns from sky to sky so after all his strife 
 the wasted weeks had tripped him the fierce hours of pleading for the seas command great hours and golden moments all were lost 
 the fleet of had won the channel without a blow 
 all eyes were turned on as he stood there a giant against the sunset and the sea looming alone 
 far off the first white star gleamed in a rosy space of heaven 
 he tossed a grim black ball i the lustrous air and laughed come lads he said time to finish the game book few minutes and well wasted those were spent on that great game of bowls for well knew what panic threatened since his fleet lay trapped there by the black that blew straight up the sound and town itself except the ships won ere the dawn lay at the mercy 
 never a seaman of all the clustered on the and all the captains round lord hoped that one ship might win to the open sea at dawn they thought the rolling guns to in an hour must shatter them huddled in their red like sheep 
 now was the great sun sunken and the night dark 
 far to westward like the soul of man fighting blind nature a flare of red upon some windy headland suddenly leapt and vanished into the clouds 
 again it leapt and vanished then all at once it streamed steadily as a crimson torch upheld by hands to heaven 
 it was the first beacon a sudden silence swept along the and in their midst appeared 
 then the jubilant thunder of his voice rolled the far and nigh 
 and ere they knew what power as of a sea 
 surged through them his immortal revenge had flung out cables to the 
 and while the seamen as he had commanded knotted thick ropes together he stood apart for well he knew what panic threatened still idly at a scrap of wood and carved a little boat out for the child of some old 
 so great and calm a master of the world seemed that as he and the chips fluttered into the blackness over the 
 men said that in this hour of need each tiny turned to a for now began the one by one 
 to glitter and half reveal the shadowy hulks before him 
 so the huge old legend grew not all unworthy the age of gods and godlike men 
 st
 mount answering the first wild beacon far away 
 rolled crimson to the stormy sky the ropes were knotted 
 through the panting dark great heaving lines of seamen all together hauled with a shout and all together again hauled with a shout against the roaring wind and slowly slowly onward the sea moved the revenge and ever heaved the backs together and in their midst 
 suddenly as they slackened was there hauling like any ten and with his heart doubling the strength of all giving them joy of battle against those odds till they found delight in the burning of the blood that even their hardy hands must feel the harsh rough straining ropes 
 there as they toiled answering a score of hills old head streamed like a furnace to the rolling clouds then all around the coast each windy and craggy mountain kindled 
 peak from peak caught the tremendous fire and passed it on round the bluff east and the black mouth of up northward to the waste wild and gloomy where like a giant 
 o great grasped red brand and thrust it up against the reeling heavens 
 then all night long inland the wandering winds ran wild with and clash of startled bells all night the cities with torches flashed with thousand flames of burnished steel while over the and thunder of hooves blazed forth the lightning of wild 
 lonely lanes of country darkness lit by cottage doors entwined rose and roared like now last and south as to the coasts pike and musket streamed the trained bands horse and foot from every town and every hamlet 
 all the shaggy hills from haven to the downs of and up to gleamed with many a hedge of between the crimson while in red thousand men case the invader should prevail drew swords around their queen 
 all night in dark st
 while round it rolled a multitudinous roar as of the on a beach 
 and all the leaning streets were lit with fury of torches rose the passionate prayer of peril lord god of hosts let thine enemies know that thou hast taken into thine hands the mighty sound rolled round the kneeling then died 
 echoing up the heights 
 a voice far off as on the cross of caught it up and poured the prayer that deep hush alone we beseech thee god to go before our armies bless and prosper them both by land and sea grant unto them thy victory god as thou to do to thy children when they please thee all power all strength all victory come from thee then from the lips of all those thousands burst a sound as from the rent heart of an ocean one one great rushing storm of wings the darkness round the gates of heaven some their trust in and some in horses bid we will remember thy name lord our god so while at sound her seamen toiled all through the night and scarce a ship had won the heart of cried to god 
 all night while yelled and blared without and signal cannon shook the panes and multitudes went thundering by amid that solemn pillared hush arose from lips of kneeling thousands one great prayer storming the gates of heaven lord our god heavenly father have mercy upon our queen to whom thy far dispersed flock do fly in the anguish of their souls 
 behold behold how many princes band themselves against her how long thy servant hath to them for peace how proudly they prepare themselves for battle arise therefore maintain thine own cause judge thou between her and her she not her own honour but thine not the of others but thy truth not bloodshed but the saving of the afflicted rend the heavens therefore and come down deliver thy people to is all one with thee by few or many want or wealth weakness or strength 
 the cause is thine the enemies thine the afflicted thine the honour victory and thine grant her people now one heart mind one strength 
 give unto her councils and her captains wisdom and courage strongly to withstand the forces of her enemies that the fame and glory of thy kingdom may be spread unto the ends of the world 
 father we crave this in thy mercy for the precious death of thy dear son our saviour amen 
 and as the dreadful dawn broke and out of sound at last with ringing from many a thousand struggled six little ships all that the nights long toil had warped down to the sea but leading them the ship of there rose one from all those worshippers let god arise and let his enemies be scattered under the leaden of that new dawn empty and cold indifferent as death the sea heaved strangely to the 
 seeing all round them only the leaden surge wrapped in wet mists or flashing here and there with crumbling white 
 against the cold wet wind westward the little ships of beat with short close inshore striving to win the station of the threatening battle that neared behind the veil 
 six little ships 
 no more beat westward even as all beats up against that universal wind whereon like withered leaves all else is blown down one wide way to death the soul alone 
 whether at last it wins or and fails stems the dark tide with its intrepid sails 
 many a short tack struggled and strained northwest southwest the ships but ever westward gained some little way with every tack and soon 
 while the plunged beneath the noon lapped by the crackling waves even as the wind died down a little in the mists behind stole out from sound the struggling score of ships that might not win last night to sea 
 they followed but the six went on before 
 not knowing alone for god and liberty 
 now as they tacked northwest the sullen roar of crept out or some strange tinkling sound of sheep upon the hills 
 southwest once more the whistle swung their round southwest until the long low lapping splash was all they heard of that still ran out then with one muffled heave and crash once more the brought their sails about 
 and now the noon began to the west with slow rich filled and shadowy forms dark curdling wreaths and with breast and tangled zones of dusk like frozen storms motionless with sunset with doom motionless nay across the darkening deep surely the whole sky moved its gorgeous gloom onward and like the curtains of a sleep the red crumbled mists dissolved away there like deaths secret dawning a dream great thrones of thunder the dying day 
 and higher pale towers of cloud began to gleam 
 there in one storm great masts and clouds of sail crept slowly forth the ships of from north to south their tangled and controlled the slow wind as with bit and rein onward they rode in insolent disdain sighting the little fleet of there while the sullen of the main three solemn guns tolled all their host to prayer and their great all the air 
 the sacred standard of their proud crusade up to the of their soared on one side knelt the holy on one the crucified poured his blood and all their kneeling hosts adored their saints and clouds of incense heavenward streamed while pomp of and pike and sword down long of mocking menace gleamed and chant of priests rolled out seas that dreamed 
 who comes to fight for is it ye six little straws that dance upon the foam sweeping the sea let the pageant in its glory come leaving the sunset like a hecatomb of souls whose bodies yet endure the chain let slaves by thousands scarred and dumb in those dark galleys grip their again and the rolling deep bring on the pomp of bring on pomp of royal for all the of the land are there and for the gorgeous purple of their sins the papal pomp bring on with psalm and prayer nearer the heaves can ye not hear the rushing foam not see the arms 
 and hosts leagues of golden air crowding the decks muttering their beads and charms to where in heaven they thicken like bring on the pomp and pride of old blazon the skies with royal beneath let old ocean reel 
 the purple pomp of priestly bring on and let her dusk the dying sun 
 the thunder of her banners on the breeze glorious the sleeping thunder of the seas 
 while twenty thousand warriors chant her 
 lo all their decks are kneeling sky to sky responds it is their solemn evening hour 
 salve though the daylight die 
 salve though the darkness have they not still the kingdom and the power salve their thousands cry from where like clouds to where like mountains tower their crowded looming far or nigh salve what distant seas what distant seas what distant ages hear bring on the pomp the sun of goes down the moon but swells the tide of praise and prayer bring on the worldwide pomp of her renown let darkness crown her with a crown and let her watch the fierce waves crouch and fawn round those huge hulks from which her cannon frown 
 while close inshore the wet are drawn round then wait in triumph for the dawn 
 the sun of goes down the night is dark still are her thousands praying still their cry from the wide waste of waters maria darker grows the sky maria those about to die salute thee nay what wandering winds with random gusts of chilling prophecy against the solemn sounds that heavenward stream the night is come at last 
 break not the splendid dream 
 but through the misty darkness close inshore northwest southwest and ever westward strained the little ships of 
 all night long as down the coast the leapt the crackle and lapping splash of tacking the low sharp and the whine of ropes mixing with many a cry disturbed the darkness waking vague swift fears among the mighty hulks of that lay nearest then fading through the mists inshore northwest then growing again but farther down their ranks to westward with each dark return and dark departure till the rank of grim heard the and creak pass the wet to now of all that monstrous host 
 then heard no more than wandering cries wheeling around their leagues of 
 or heave of waters waiting for the dawn 
 dawn everlasting and dawn rolled the waters 
 the mists were fled 
 see in their reeking crescent drawn those masts and and cloudy sails outspread like one great tempest soaked with red in vain withstand the march of skies the dawn onward and the night is dead and lo to what bright menace lies what glory now in wakening eyes there on the glittering plains of open sea 
 to now behind the fleets of two little files of ships arc tossing free 
 free of the winds and of the main were they not trapped who brought them forth 
 free of the great new fields of war 
 with sails like blossoms shining after rain 
 and guns that sparkle to the morning star first upon the deep that rolls to and knows well that flag of fiery fame knows who leads those files across the sea implacable invincible his name creeps hissing through her ranks to but now she holds the rolling heavens in fee his ships are few 
 they surge across the foam the hunt is up but need the mountains flee or fear the snarling wolf pack let them come they crouch but dare not leap upon the of 
 nearer come and nearer nay prepare close your huge ranks that sweep from sky to sky madness itself would shrink but will dare eternal hell let the great signal fly close up our ranks comes down to die is brave the vast loom heaven spares one smile of chivalry one wintry smile across her gloom as that frail fleet comes rushing its doom 
 suddenly as the wild change of a dream even as the watched those lean sharp leap straight at their huge hulks watched well content knowing their foes once grappled must be doomed even as they caught the rush and hiss of foam across that narrow dwindling gleam of sea 
 and heard abruptly close the sharp commands and steady answers caught one glimpse of seamen waiting by their guns the vision changed the ships of swerved swiftly a volley of flame and thunder swept blinding the buffeted air a volley of iron from four sheer crashing a hulk of 
 she reeled blind in the fiery surge and fury of that assault 
 so swift it seemed that as she to ere her guns trained on the foe once more the cloud that wrapped the sea once twice and thrice again split with red thunderclaps that rent and raked her huge beams through and through 
 as she to still her own grim cannon belched their lava wounding the void air and as by miracle the ships of were gone 
 along the rear they swept from north to south them as they went at close range hardly a away with volley on volley 
 never had seen seamen or like to these who sailed two knots against her one 
 they came and went suddenly neared or sheered away at will as if by magic pouring flame and iron in four full some hulk ere one of hers burst blindly at the sky 
 southward along the rear they swept 
 then swung about and sheets of flame iron and death along the same fierce road littered with reeking with fumes returned triumphantly rushing all their sails aloft with the wind 
 then then from sky to sky one surge of baleful pride with clouds and towers of sail would onward the of which the groaning main and held the of faith in fee beating against the wind struggling in vain to close with swift had all earth in charge had then the sea had the mountains mountains flow like clouds 
 had great kingdoms kingdoms melt away yet in that crescent army on army crowds how shall she fear what seas or winds can say the seas that leap and shine round decay 
 the that mount and sing while empires fall 
 and mountains pass like waves in the winds way 
 and dying gods shuddering call 
 had then the sea that one and all see in gigantic wrath the rata her mighty round to the wild sea wind the deep like one black maelstrom round her while great follows hard behind reeling like blind 
 they strive to cross the ships of yea challenge them to the grapple and only find red bursting the bursting spray and surging still along her way to still revenge and flash and thunder and the sea flames red between in vain against the wind the crash and plunge and pour blind the screen of rolling clouds at dimly seen that to and like fly ever to the great hulks their thousand cannon can but wound the sky 
 while little rainbow foams and flashes by 
 suddenly the of stung to fury it seemed like an avalanche to then reeled out beyond the rest against the wind alone daring the foe to grapple her 
 at once the little revenge with flag flying flashed at her throat and hardly a away broadside on broadside under those great cannon crashing through beams four shots to one while and the rest swept to and keeping at deadly bay the rolling hulks that looming like now plunged desperately against the wind to rescue the great where she lay alone amid the of alone like a volcanic island lashed with crimson the winds with isolated the skies with wrathful lava while great and blocks leapt through the cloudy glare and far off and so they came at dead of night on de they saw the lights across the waves glittering and the shadowy hulks of ships gathered together like a flock of sheep within the port 
 with shouts and of chains a shadowy ship was entering from the north and like the shadow of that shadow slipped the golden beside her the gloom and side by side they anchored in the port amidst the shipping over the dark tide a small boat from the drew near 
 a sleepy yawning officer boarded the golden and with a cry stumbling against a he saw the seamen in the gloom all waiting by their guns 
 wildly he plunged over the side and urged his boat away crying at that dread word the darkness filled with and the ships cutting their cables drifted here and there in mad attempts to seek the open sea 
 wild lights burnt hither and thither and all the port one furnace of confusion and in terror for each shadow of the night nay the great night itself was all 
 the dragons wings were spread from to the very lights that burnt from mast to mast and flared across the tide kindled his breath to fire while here and there a slipped softly the roaring gloom and glare ransacking ship by ship for each one thought a fleet had come upon them 
 each gave up the struggle as each was boarded while elsewhere cannon to cannon friends friends 
 yet not one ounce of treasure in they found for fourteen days before they came that greatest of with all the gorgeous harvest of that year had sailed for her ballast silver bars her cargo rubies emeralds and gold 
 out through the and the darkness out out to the mouth the golden steered by the iron soul of returned and where the way was blocked her cannon clove a crimson highway to the midnight sea 
 then northward northward the jewelled main 
 under the white moon like a storm they drove in quest of the 
 fourteen days her start was and at dawn the fair wind sank 
 and chafing lay the golden becalmed while on the hills the of marched down from with two thousand men and sent out four huge ships of war to sink or capture the fierce dragon 
 loud laughed to see them creeping nigh urged with great then suddenly pause for none would be the first to close with him 
 and ere they had steeled their hearts to battle a fair breeze broke out anew 
 and northward sped the little golden in quest of the of 
 behind her lay a world in arms for now wrath and confusion for revenge from sea to sea 
 claimed the pirates head from and awaited his return with all her tortures 
 and he passed he the dragons teeth and everywhere broods of armed men arose and followed followed on his fiery trail 
 men toiled at to fit out a fleet grim enough to destroy him 
 all night long the flare went up from cities on the coast where men like naked devils toiled to cast cannon that might have overwhelmed the powers of when he that hideous through livid chaos to the black abyss 
 small hope indeed there seemed of safe return but northward sped the little golden the ship of eighteen guns undaunted and upon the second dawn sighted a not indeed the chase 
 yet worth a pause for out of her they took embossed with emeralds large as pigeons eggs a golden crucifix with eighty pounds in weight of gold 
 the rest they left behind and onward onward to the north they flew a score of golden miles a score of green an hundred miles eight hundred miles of foam and ransacking as they went ship after ship for news o the chase and gold learning from every capture that they drew nearer and nearer 
 at dim and dreaming city with purple flowers 
 she had paused paused to take a freight of gold at she had passed two days in front only two days two days ahead nay one at close inshore a youthful page 
 ran up the rigging and cried a sail a sail the and the chain is mine and by the strange cut of her sails whereof they had been told in they knew her heavily laden with her gems lazily drifting with her golden over the magic seas they saw her hull loom as they onward drew but for fear the prey might take alarm and run ashore trailed filled with water over the side to hold his ship back till the darkness fell 
 and with the night the offshore wind arose 
 at last the sun sank down rosy light faded from and snow the rose the were and like a hound unleashed the golden leapt forward the gloom 
 a cables length divided them 
 the heard a rough voice in the darkness bidding her heave to she held her course 
 gave the word 
 a broadside shattered the night and over her side her clattered like a broken wing on to her decks the swarmed cutlass in hand that fight was at an end 
 the ship was cleared a prize crew placed aboard then both ships turned their heads to the open sea 
 at dawn being out of sight of land they examine the great prize 
 none ever knew save and what wild wealth they had captured there 
 thus much at least was known an of gold and twenty tons of silver thirteen chests of coins of gold unnumbered countless pearls diamonds emeralds but the worth of these was past all reckoning 
 in the crimson dawn ringed with the lonely pomp of sea and sky the seamen bathed in gold and gathered up fruit gems and tossed them in the sun 
 the hold like one great elfin orchard gleamed with dusky globes and tawny glories piled apples heap on heap 
 rich with the hues of sunset rich and ripe orb the

 till the soft luxurious coasts hardened the winds grew bleak the great green waves loomed high like mountains round them and the spray froze on their and yards 
 fresh from the warmth of seas the men could hardly brook that cold and when the floating hills of ice like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow went past them with strange whispers in the gloom or took mysterious in the dawn their hearts them and they found no way but all was iron shore and icy sea 
 and one by one the crew fell sick to death in that fierce 
 and the land still ran westward and showed no passage 
 tossed storms onward they plunged or furrowed gentler tides of emerald that made the prow a faery of some enchanted ship wild round her as she drove seas by mortal 
 past of any human voice where sound and silence mingled in one song of utter solitude 
 ever as they went the flag of the broad breeze northward where never ship had sailed before northward till lost in helpless dazed as a soul awakening from the dream of death to some wild dawn in paradise yet burnt with cold as they whose very tears freeze on their faces where wails all bruised and wrenched blackened lightning scarred as with evil deeds but all in beauty by that sun which never sets peace at last the rocked on a glittering calm 
 seas that no ship had ever sailed from sky to glistening sky 
 swept round them 
 glory and gleam glamour and lucid rapture and diamond air embraced her broken with gold her gloomy hull rocking upon a sphere new made it seemed mysterious with the first of the world holy sky and sacred sea shone like the primal light of god with wlii
speiinj wings and glorious with clouds 
 only all day all night the rhythmic utterance of his will in the deep sigh of seas that washed his rose and across eternity timed to the pulse of 
 all their world seemed strange as unto us the great new heavens and glittering shores if on some bark to coasts we came and traced no more the tiny gleam of our familiar earth far oft but heard tremendous oceans roll round continents and saw terrible mountains unto which our were less than and such gaunt them and such roaring down as burst the gates of our senses pour the eternal glory on our souls 
 and while ten thousand bring the dawn hurl us poor trembling to our knees 
 glory and glamour and rapture of lucid air ice cold with subtle of the sky embraced her broken belted her hulk with brilliance while she dipped her in waves of mounded and sometimes a great flashed and floated by on the waters and crowned with all the jewels in the world or in the darkness glimmering on all emerald to the moon went by like ghosts whispering to the south 
 there as they lay waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails their hearts remembered that in now the spring was nigh and in that lonely sea the skilled musicians filled their eyes with home 
 song i it is the now under the the goes her eyes are violets blue washed with the morning dew 
 her mouth a rose 
 it is the now 
 the lanes are growing the and bleat in all the meadows the glossy dappled blink in the warm sunshine cooling their shadows 
 it is the now 
 ill soon hand in sunburnt hand gods green our home whispering as they stray the lovers will roam 
 it is the now 
 and then with many a chain of linked sweetness harmonious gold they drew their hearts and soul back back to thoughts of wife and child mother and sweetheart and the old companions the twisted streets of and the deep delight of lanes all softly voiced in words or made them breathe hard and gaze across the everlasting sea 
 craving for that small isle so far away 
 song i you beautiful land with and bright with the largesse of may sweet from the palm of her hand till the hedges grew white as the billows with spray 
 white from the fall of her feet the daisies awake in the sun and valley and plain with the breath of the growing sweet laugh for the spring is begun and love hath turned homeward again 
 you beautiful land ill where should the home be of love but there where the blows and the trips out with her pail and the in heaven above sings till the west is a rose and the east is a nightingale you beautiful land there where the trees are shading the and oaks whose brethren of old conquered the strength of the seas grow broad in the sunlight and shine crowned with their of gold you land with and bright with above broad and grand the meadows blossom are white for the footfall the footfall of love 
 beautiful land how should we sing of thy beauty mother of men 
 we that can look in thine eyes and see there the of duty deep as the depth of their ken wide as the ring of thy skies 
 you land with and bright with the largesse of may sweet from the palm of her hand till the hedges grew as the billows with spray you beautiful land and when a fair wind rose again there seemed no hope of passage by that fabled way northward and suddenly put down his helm and with some wondrous purpose in his eyes turned southward once again until he found a lonely natural on the coast near where the cliffs were white like those of and the soft soil with gold 
 there they careened the golden her keel being thick with and weeds and built a fort and to little wandering home not half so large as many a today that scarce would cross the channel yet she had swept the seas of half the world and even now for nev
 adventures greater than them all 
 and as the sound of chisel and hammer broke the stillness of that shore shy figures came and from the woods to bow before the strange newcomers as gods 
 the chaplain all aghast persuaded them with signs and broken words and that even was but a man whom none the less the savages would crown with woven flowers and barbarous ritual king of new so the seamen called that land remembering the white of home 
 they implored with many a sign and cry which by the rescued slaves upon the prize were part interpreted that would stay and rule them and the vision of the great of arose and flashed a moment round them on that lonely shore 
 a small and weatherbeaten band they stood bronzed seamen by the laughing rescued slaves ringed with gigantic loneliness and saw an empire that should liberate the world a power before the lightning of whose arms darkness should die and all oppression cease a federation of the strong and weak whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong stronger in the increasing good of all a gathering up of one loads a turning of the wasteful rage of war to large and fruitful tasks of peace 
 even as the strength of some great stream is turned to grind the corn for bread 
 thus on that which those in dreams foresaw and saw not with their living eyes but thou mayst lift up eyes at last and see 
 who like that angel of the apocalypse hast set one foot upon thy isle the other upon the waters and raise now if thou wilt above the assembled nations the trumpet of deliverance to thy lips 
 at last their task was done the her white wings hoisted and away westward they swiftly glided from the shore where with a wild lament their friends i the foam all stood at gaze like men that for one moment in their lives have seen a mighty drama cross their path and played upon the stage of vast events knowing all their life is 
 but westward sped the little golden across the uncharted ocean with no guide but that great homing cry of all their hearts 
 far out of sight of land they steered straight out across the great in those days when even the compass proved no guide 
 straight out they struck in that small bark straight out week after week without one glimpse of but heaving seas across the uncharted waste straight to the sunset 
 laughingly they sailed with all that gorgeous booty in their holds a dragging deep through seas of doom a prey to the first great hurricane that blew except their god averted it 
 and still their skilled musicians cheered the way along to shores the sunset and the sea 
 and oft at nights the yellow swung over swarthy singing faces grouped within the four small wooden walls that made their home and shut them from the unfathomable depths of mysterious gloom without that rolled all around them or would heartily a simple stave that struggled oft with thoughts beyond its reach yet reached their hearts no less 
 song i good luck befall you all that sail this so ire go not yet we know ire steer by wind and tide 
 be it right or wrong i sing this song for now it seems to men steer their soils r and shoals as use by sea 
 chorus as use by sea my lads 
 as use by sea and now they to now they drive before the gale now are they hurled the world with torn and tattered sail yet as they will they steer and still defy the worlds rude glee till death overwhelm them mast and helm they ride and rule the sea 
 chorus they ride and rule the sea my lads they ride and rule the sea meantime in of love and queen being told that was dead and with grief obeying her fathers will that dreadful summer in bridal robes had passed to wed her fathers choice 
 the sun streamed smiling on her as she went amidst her smiling maids 
 nigh to the sea the church was and the marriage bells with its music 
 far away white sails the white as flying blossoms from her crown but as the glad and sad procession neared the little church from some strange far out at sea there came a sudden tiny puff of smoke and then a dull strange a whistling hiss and scarce a score of yards away a shot up the turf 
 none knew none ever knew from whence it came whether a perilous jest of seamen or a wanton deed of or mere accident but all her maids in flight were scattered 
 awoke as from a dream crying aloud he he that sends this message 
 he is not dead 
 i will not pass the porch 
 come home with me 
 he that sent that message 
 availed her fathers her mothers tears her maids cunning persuasions home she returned and waited for the dead to come to life nor waited long for ere that month was out on reached the coasts of borne as it seemed on wings that was on his homeward way 
 book the imperial of one worldwide sea of furious pomp and flouted power now surged all round this little isle with one harsh roar deepening for return the golden ye swore had ye was drowned they are on their homeward way the head of what answer what account what recompense now can ye yield our might invincible except the head of whose bloody deeds have reddened the who hath cities of gold burnt fleets and ruined realms 
 what answer but his life to which the queen who saw the storm of slowly rising in menace her throne and of the storm the robes of and murderous hand grasping the cross by its great hilt pointing it like a brand at the throat of saw like skeleton castles in rolling mist the monstrous engines and designs of war the secret fleets and brooding prepared growing from day to day in dusk and embattled gloom surrounding her replied the life of if on our strict in due order we find that have hurt our friends mark well if have hurt our friends the life of 
 and while the world awaited him as men might wait an earthquake quietly one grey one grey of mist and rain when all the in dripped with listless drizzle and only through her streets rumbled the with its dreary bell for the plague had lately like a sucked the veins of town a little ship grey as a ghost glided into the sound and anchored scarce a soul to see her come and not an eye to read the faded around her battered prow the golden 
 then the dumb grey misty listless port a like the of the dawn streamed the shining up the wet streets 
 in at the tavern doors flashed from the panes and turned them into diamonds fired the pools in every muddy lane with gold flushed in a thousand faces is come down every crowding alley the leaped tossing their caps the golden is come fisherman citizen dame and maid fat justice baker bloated butcher minister and apothecary 
 yea even the driver of the leaving his ghastly load using his dreary bell to purpose down the streets panting tumbling to the waterside to the waterside they rushed and some beyond it all one wild welcome to wild fluttering thunderous rolling from to a thousand arms to that grey ghostly little ship at whose the flag still flew then over all in one tumultuous tide of joy the bells a nations welcome home to 
 the very golden no idle dream 
 the little ship that swept the main carelessly lying there in sound the golden the wonder of the world a glory her and no boat dared yet approach save one with close friends who came to warn him stands alone and is made the price of peace 
 the queen perforce must with the invincible she hath forfeited thy life to against her will 
 only by this rejection of thee as a she averted instant war for now the menace of draws looms darker every hour 
 the world is made footstool 
 the king now hath added to her boundless power without a blow the vast domains and wealth of and yet a coast that over against us 
 holds a huge none knows where to strike and even this day a flying horseman brought that hath landed a great force in 
 of only waits the word to stab us in the side for 
 the queen weighed down by friends of peace at any cost may yet be driven to make thy life our ransom which indeed she already sworn or seemed to swear 
 to whom answered lives and in her life mine only fear lies dead mine only fear for not myself 
 willing am i and glad as have lived to die for sake 
 yet lest the queen be driven now to restore this cargo that i bring her a worlds wealth the golden of all the power of the jewelled hearts of all those cruel realms for i have plucked them out beyond the sea lest she be driven to yield them up again for and delight i will warp out behind st
 island 
 the fierce plague in shall be and excuse 
 until my return from court with will 
 if it be death ill out again to sea its rough floor with costlier than kings can throw and ere i die will the beard and set the fringe of his imperial robe blazing along his coasts 
 then let him roll his round the little golden bring her to bay if he can on the high seas ring us about with thousands well not yield i and my golden we will go down with flag still flying on the last stump left us and all my cannon spitting out the fires of everlasting scorn into his face 
 so warped out the golden anew behind st
 island 
 she lay there the small centre of the world that raged all round her the last hope the star of freedom she the outlawed ship holding within her the great head and heart of ocean power and all fleets that have earth in that small ship lay waiting for their doom 
 past her at night glided wondering as they heard in the thick darkness the great songs they deemed must oft have risen from many a lonely sea for oft had brought a back of that strange pirate who in royal state sailed to a sound of violins and dined with skilled musicians round him turning all battle and storm and death into a song 
 song the same sun is us 
 the same love shall find us the same and none other wherever we be with the same hope before us the same home behind us our mother 
 ringed round with the sea 
 no land in the ring of it now all around us only the splendid unknown how should we sing of it 
 this that hath found us by the great stars attended at midnight alone our highway none knoweth 
 yet our blood hath discerned it clear clear is our path now foreheads are free where the hurricane our spirits have learned it the highway of now the storms way the sea 
 when the waters lay breathless gazing at guarding that glorious of gold heard we the wonderful whisper we follow victorious tonight as of old 
 ah the broad miles of it white with the onset of waves without number for glee ah the soft smiles of it down to the sunset sacred for slumber the swans bath the sea when the breakers charged thundering in thousands all round us with a lightning of lances on high when the stout ships were a rapture hath crowned us like the wild light that dances on the crests that flash by 
 our highway none knoweth yet our blood hath discerned it clear clear is our path now whose foreheads are free where our spirits have learned it the highway of wrath now the storm way the sea who now will follow us where flag us where gold not 
 nor statesmen betray 
 the deep midnight swallow us let her cry when she us we return her the way 
 for the same sun is us the same love shall find us the same and none other wherever we he with the same hope before us the same home behind us our mother ringed round with the sea 
 so six days passed and on the seventh returned the with a message from the queen to court bidding him bring also such curious of his voyage as might amuse her also be of good cheer she bade him and rest well content his life in hands were safe so laughingly landed with his crew amid the throng on beach and loaded twelve big with pearls beyond all price diamonds crosses of gold 
 rubies that once for kings and great dead crowns 
 also he said well add a sack or of gold pieces of eight 
 and trash for those poor lords at court lilies that toil not neither spin 
 their purses oft grow lean in these harsh times 
 even as well their tongues wagged in our favour now as in our blame 
 six days thereafter a fearful whisper reached plenipotentiary of in that the pirate was now in secret conference with the queen nay more that he the of the world even he that bloody had six hours audience with her majesty daily nay more walked with her in her garden alone among the fiery autumn leaves talking of god knows what and suddenly the diplomatic voice of caution he was wont to expect from and accept as his imperial due changed to a ringing key of firm resolve 
 resistance nay defiance 
 for when he came demanding audience of the queen behold her officers of state with mouths awry informed the high ambassador of despite his pomp and circumstance the queen could not receive him being in conference with some rough seaman pirate what you will a fellow made of bronze a like a lion bearded like a with hammered head clamped jaws and great deep eyes that burned with fierce blue of the and liked not the very name 
 one a that had stood 
 thundering commands against the thundering heavens 
 on decks and drunk great draughts of glory from the rolling sea nor could she promise to ambassador nor see his face again while yet one remained in 
 vainly the raged of restitution recompense for now had brought up the little golden to and the rumor of her wealth the wild reality 
 the crew were princes as they swaggered down the streets in weatherbeaten 
 out of their doors to wonder and stare the citizens ran when they went by and through the length and breadth of now the gathering glory of life shone like the dawn 
 hill and it streamed 
 dawn everlasting and dawn making a golden pomp of every oak had not its brethren swept the seas in each remotest hamlet by the hearth the cart the grey the village pump by meadow and mill and old hall by turnpike and by tavern farm and forge 
 men staved the crimson vintage of romance and held it up against the light and drank it and with it drank confusion to the wrath that menaced but eternal honour while blood ran in their veins to 
 book meanwhile young of the queen of deep heart in her home 
 fenced by her fathers angry watch and ward lest he the poor plebeian dread of shaker of nations king of the seas might win some word with her sweet the flower triumphant their rusty 
 waited her lover as in ancient tales the pale princess from some grey tower the deep sigh of enchanted woods looks for the flash of her knights shield or on the further side o the magic west sees pushing through the ethereal golden gloom some blurred black prow with loaded coarse clouded with of a mortal sea and rich with earthly crimson 
 she with lips apart still waits the shattering golden thrill when it shall grate the coasts of 
 only to of there came no sight or sound to break that frozen spell and lonely watch no message from her love 
 or none that reached her restless helpless hands 
 only the general of the world borne to her by the gossip of her maid kept the swift pictures passing her brain of how the golden was hauled ashore at through a sea of exultation and by the queens command was now set up for an everlasting memory of how the queen with subtle still kept at dangling while she played at fast and loose with embassy arriving with the found and trembled at her daring since the of seemed in their eyes to with foam the hulk a gorgeous banquet spread to greet them on that golden which the main a gorgeous feast the like of which old had not seen since the bluff days of boisterous king great shields of with mustard roasted swans haunches of venison roasted chines of beef 
 and baked big thereto and mixed with sugar and white vine and 
 there on the outlawed ship whose very name rang like a blasphemy in the imperial ears of its every old plank being scored with scorn and courage that not storm nor death nor all their racks 
 the irons and bloody whips that scarred the backs of pale 
 her captured seamen ever could daunt there with huge empires waiting for one word 
 one breath of and excuse to leap like wolves at the naked throat of her small isle 
 there in the eyes of the staggered world she stood 
 great while the live decks reeled with flash of jewels and flush of rustling 
 she stood the and her people surged like a sea around 
 there did she give open defiance her smile to 
 behold this pirate now she cried whose head my lord the invincible of demands from 
 kneel 
 master kneel down for now have i this gilded sword wherewith to strike it off 
 nay thou my lord ambassador of since i be woman and squeamish at the sight of blood give thou the accolade 
 with that jest she gave the hilt thus even in boldness playing a crafty part and dangling before the adventurous deed to and in the face of with that huge fleet in and the whole of crouching around her isle the of the unknown world sir 
 and then the came of vaster planned by against the coasts of but held in check and fretting at the leash as ever the queen clung to her while enemies worked in the dark against him

 still beset path with pitfalls treacherous greed for all the dark around him and john without cease sought to make use of all until by chance the proof of intrigue with against him up to the deadly hilt 
 and hurled him into the tower 
 many a night she sat by that old nigh the sea and heard its ebb and flow 
 with soul erect and splendid now she waited yet there came no message and she thought he hath seen at last my little worth

 i love your arms when the warm white flesh touches mine in a fond embrace i love your hair when the strands your kisses against my face 
 not for me the cold calm kiss of a bloodless love not for me the saints white bliss nor the heart of a spotless dove 
 but give me the love that so freely gives and laughs at the whole worlds blame with your body so young and warm in my arms it sets my poor heart aflame

 deep passionate love poems for him remember by remember me when i am gone away gone far away into the silent land when you can no more hold me by the hand nor i half turn to go yet turning stay 
 remember me when no more day by day you tell me of our future that you only remember me you understand it will be late to counsel then or pray 
 yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember do not for if the darkness and corruption leave a vestige of the thoughts that once i had better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad 
 love and friendship by love is like the wild friendship like the the is dark when the blooms but which will bloom most constantly the wild is sweet in spring its summer blossoms scent the air yet wait till winter comes again and who will call the fair then scorn the silly now and deck thee with the sheen that when thy brow he still may leave thy garland green 
 sweet love poems for him that will make him cry love by this is a word we use to plug holes with 
 its the right size for those warm blanks in speech for those red heart shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing like real hearts 
 add lace and you can sell it 
 we insert it also in the one empty space on the printed form that comes with no instructions 
 there are whole magazines with not much in them but the word love you can rub it all over your body and you can cook with it too 
 how do we know it what goes on at the cool of slugs under damp pieces of cardboard as for the weed seedlings nosing their tough up among the they shout it 
 love love sing the soldiers raising their glittering knives in salute 
 then the two of us 
 this word is far too short for us it has only four letters too sparse to fill those deep bare between the stars that press on us with their 
 its not love we wish to fall into but that fear 
 this word is not enough but it will have to do 
 its a single vowel in this metallic silence a mouth that says o again and again in wonder and pain a breath a finger grip on a 
 you can hold on or let go 
 short deep love poems for him the meeting by we started speaking looked at each other then turned away 
 the tears kept rising to my eyes 
 but i could not weep 
 i wanted to take your hand but my hand trembled 
 you kept counting the days before we should meet again 
 but both of us felt in our hearts that we parted for ever and ever 
 the ticking of the little clock filled the quiet room 
 listen i said 
 it is so loud like a horse galloping on a lonely road as loud as a horse galloping past in the night 
 you shut me up in your arms 
 but the sound of the clock stifled our hearts beating 
 you said i can not go all that is living of me is here for ever and ever 
 then you went 
 the world changed 
 the sound of the clock grew dwindled away became a minute thing 
 i whispered in the darkness 
 if it stops i shall die 
 the kiss by i hoped that he would love me and he has kissed my mouth but i am like a stricken bird that can not reach the south 
 for though i know he loves me tonight my heart is sad his kiss was not so wonderful as all the dreams i had 
 gorgeous love poems for him at last by at last when all the summer shine that warmed early hours is past your loving fingers seek for mine and hold them last not oft the robin comes to build its nest upon the bough by autumn robbed by winter chilled but you dear heart you love me now 
 though there are shadows on my brow and furrows on my cheek in truth the marks where times remorseless broke up the blooming of youth though fled is every girlish grace might win or hold a lovers vow despite my sad and faded face and darkened heart you love me now i count no more my wasted tears they left no echo of their fall i mourn no more my lonesome years this blessed hour for all 
 i fear not all that time or fate may bring to burden heart or brow strong in the love that came so late our souls shall keep it always now love poems for him that will make him cry by lord a come into the garden for the black bat night has flown come into the garden i am here at the gate alone and the spices are abroad and the of the rose is blown 
 for a breeze of morning moves and the planet of love is on high beginning to faint in the light that she loves in a bed of sky to faint in the light of the sun she loves to faint in his light and to die 
 all night have the roses heard the flute violin all night has the to the dancers dancing in tune till a silence fell with the waking bird and a hush with the setting moon 
 i said to the there is but one with whom she has heart to be gay 
 when will the dancers leave her alone she is weary of dance and play 
 now half to the setting moon are gone and half to the rising day low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away 
 i said to the rose the brief night goes in and revel and wine 
 o young what sighs are those for one that will never be thine but mine but mine so i to the rose for ever and ever mine 
 and the soul of the rose went into my blood as the music in the hall and long by the garden lake i stood for i heard your fall from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood our wood that is dearer than all from the meadow your walks have left so sweet that whenever a sighs he sets the of your feet in violets blue as your eyes to the hollows in which we meet and the valleys of paradise 
 the slender acacia would not shake one long on the tree the white fell into the lake as the dozed on the but the rose was awake all night for your sake knowing your promise to me the lilies and roses were all awake they for the dawn and thee 
 queen rose of the garden of girls come hither the dances are done in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls queen and rose in one shine out little head sunning over with curls to the flowers and be their sun 
 there has fallen a splendid tear from the at the gate 
 she is coming my dove my dear she is coming my life my fate the red rose cries she is near she is near and the white rose she is late the larkspur listens i hear i hear and the whispers i wait 
 she is coming my own my sweet were it ever so airy a tread my heart would hear her and beat were it earth in an earthy bed my dust would hear her and beat had i lain for a century dead would start and tremble under her feet and blossom in purple and red

 thy beams so and strong why thou think i could eclipse and cloud them with a wink but that i would not lose her sight so long if her eyes have not blinded thine look and tomorrow late tell me whether both of spice and mine be where thou them or lie here with me 
 ask for those kings whom thou yesterday and thou hear all here in one bed lay 
 all states and all princes i nothing else is 
 princes do but play us compared to this all honors all wealth alchemy 
 thou sun art half as happy as we in that the worlds contracted thus 
 thine age asks ease and since thy duties be to warm the world done in warming us 
 shine here to us and thou art everywhere this bed thy center is these walls thy sphere 
 body of a woman body of a woman white hills white thighs you look like a world lying in surrender 
 my rough peasants body digs into you and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth 
 i was alone like a tunnel 
 the birds fled from me and night swamped me with its crushing invasion 
 to survive myself i forged you like a weapon like an arrow in my bow a stone in my sling 
 but the hour of vengeance falls and a love you 
 body of skin of moss of eager and firm milk 
 oh the of the breast oh the eyes of absence oh the pink roses of the oh your voice slow and sad body of my woman i will persist in your grace 
 my thirst my boundless desire my shifting road dark where the eternal thirst flows and weariness follows and the infinite ache 
 the light wraps you the light wraps you in its mortal flame 
 abstracted pale standing that way against the old of twilight that revolves around you 
 speechless my friend alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead and filled with lives of fire and pure heir of the ruined day 
 a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment 
 the great roots of night grow suddenly from your soul and the things that hide in you come out again so that a blue and pallid people your newly born takes nourishment 
 oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold rise lead and possess a creation so rich in life that its flowers perish and it is full of sadness 
 ill ah of pines ah of pines murmur of waves breaking slow play of lights solitary bell twilight falling in your eyes toy doll in whom the earth sings i n you as you aim my and in the rivers sing and my soul flees in them desire and you send it where you will road on your bow of hope a frenzy i will flee my flock of arrows 
 on all sides i see your waist of fog and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours my kisses anchor and my moist desire nests in your arms of transparent stone 
 ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and in the resonant and dying evening thus in the deep hours i have seen over the fields the ears of wheat in the mouth of the wind 
 the morning is full the morning is full of storm in the heart of summer 
 the clouds travel like white handkerchiefs of goodbye the wind traveling waving them in its hands 
 the heart of the wind beating above our loving silence 
 orchestral and divine resounding among the trees like a language full of wars and songs 
 wind that bears off the dead leaves with a quick raid and the pulsing arrows of the birds 
 wind that her in a wave without spray and substance without weight and leaning fires 
 her mass of kisses breaks and assailed in the door of the summers wind 
 so that you will hear me so that you will hear me my words sometimes grow thin as the tracks of the on the beaches 
 necklace drunken bell for your hands as smooth as grapes 
 and i watch my words from a long way off 
 they are more yours than mine 
 they climb on my old suffering ivy 
 it climbs the same way on damp walls 
 you are to blame for this cruel sport 
 they are fleeing from my dark 
 you fill everything you fill everything 
 before you they are peopled in the solitude that you occupy and they are more used to my sadness than you are 
 now i want them to say what i want to say to you and to make you hear as i you to hear me 
 the winds of anguish still hauls on them as usual 
 sometimes of dreams still knock them over 
 you listen to other voices in my painful voice lament of old mouths blood of old 
 love me companion 
 forsake me 
 follow me 
 follow me companion on this wave of anguish 
 but my words become stained with your love 
 you occupy everything you occupy everything 
 i am making them into an endless necklace for your white hands smooth as grapes 
 i remember you as you were i remember you as you were last autumn 
 you were the grey and the still heart 
 in your eyes the flames of twilight fought on 
 and the leaves fell on the water of your soul 
 clasping my arms like a climbing plant the leaves your voice that was slow and at peace 
 bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning 
 sweet blue twisted over my soul 
 i feel your eyes traveling and the autumn is far off grey voice of bird heart like a house towards which my deep longings migrated and my kisses fell happy as 
 sky from a ship 
 field from the hills your memory is made of light of smoke of a still pond beyond your eyes farther on the evenings were blazing 
 dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul 
 leaning into the afternoons leaning into the afternoons i cast my sad nets towards your eyes 
 there in the highest blaze my solitude and flames its arms turning like a drowning mans 
 i sent out red signals across your absent eyes that move like the sea near a 
 you keep only darkness my distant female from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges 
 leaning into the afternoons i fling my sad nets to the sea that beats on your marine eyes 
 the birds peck at the first stars that flash like my soul when i love you 
 the night on its shadowy mare shedding blue tassels over the land 
 white bee white bee you buzz in my soul drunk with honey and your flight winds in slow of smoke 
 i am the one without hope the word without echoes he who lost everything and he who had everything 
 last in you creaks my last longing 
 in my barren land you are the final rose 
 ah you who are silent let your deep eyes close 
 there the night 
 ah your body a frightened statue naked 
 you have deep eyes in which the night 
 cool arms of flowers and a lap of rose 
 your breasts seem like white snails 
 a butterfly of shadow has come to sleep in your belly 
 ah you who are silent here is the solitude from which you are absent 
 it is raining 
 the sea wind is hunting stray 
 the water walks barefoot in the wet streets 
 from that tree the leaves complain as though they were sick 
 white bee even when you are gone you buzz in my soul you live again in time slender and silent 
 ah you who are silent drunk with pines drunk with pines and long kisses like summer i steer the fast sail of roses bent towards the death of the thin day stuck into my solid marine madness 
 pale and lashed to my ravenous water i cruise in the sour smell of the naked climate still dressed in grey and bitter sounds and a sad crest of abandoned spray 
 hardened by passions i go mounted on my one wave lunar solar burning and cold all at once becalmed in the throat of fortunate that are white and sweet as cool hips 
 in the moist night my garment of kisses trembles charged to insanity with electric currents heroically dividing into dreams and intoxicating roses practising on me 
 upstream in the midst of the outer waves your parallel body yields to my arms like a fish infinitely fastened to my soul quick and slow in the energy under the sky 
 x we have lost even we have lost even this twilight 
 no one saw us this evening hand in hand while the blue night dropped out of the world 
 i have seen from my window the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops 
 sometimes a piece of sun burned like a coin between my hands 
 i remembered you with my soul clenched in the sadness of mine that you know 
 where were you then who else was there saying what why will the whole of love come on me suddenly when i have sad and feel you are far away the book fell that is always turned to at twilight and my cape rolled like a hurt dog at my feet 
 always always you recede through the evenings towards where the twilight goes erasing statues 
 almost out of sky almost out of the sky half of the moon anchors between two mountains 
 turning wandering night the digger of eyes 
 lets see how many stars are smashed in the pool 
 it makes a cross of mourning between my eyes and runs away 
 forge of blue metals nights of my heart revolves like a crazy wheel 
 girl who have from so far brought me so far sometimes you glance flashes out under the sky 
 rumbling storm of fury you cross above my heart without stopping 
 wind from the tombs carries off scatters your sleepy root 
 the big trees on the other side of her uprooted 
 but you cloudless girl question of smoke corn 
 you were what the wind was making with illuminated leaves 
 behind the nocturnal mountains white of conflagration ah i can say nothing you were made of everything 
 longing that sliced my breast into pieces it is time to take another road on which she does not smile 
 storm that buried the bells muddy swirl of why touch her now why make her sad 
 oh to follow the road that leads away from everything without anguish death winter waiting along it with their eyes open through the dew 
 your breast is enough your breast is enough for my heart and my wings for your freedom 
 what was sleeping above your soul will rise out of my mouth to heaven 
 in you is the illusion of each day 
 you arrive like the dew to the cupped flowers 
 you undermine the horizon with your absence 
 in flight like the wave 
 i have said that you sang in the wind like the pines and like the masts 
 like them you are tall and and you are sad all at once like a voyage 
 you gather things to you like an old road 
 you are peopled with echoes and nostalgic voices 
 i awoke and at times the birds fled and migrated that had been sleeping in your soul 
 i have gone marking i have gone marking the of your body with crosses of fire 
 my mouth went across a spider trying to hide 
 in you behind you timid driven by thirst 
 stories to tell you on the shore of the evening sad and gentle doll so that you should not be sad 
 a swan a tree something far away and happy 
 the season of grapes the ripe and fruitful season 
 i who lived in a from which i loved you 
 the solitude crossed with dream and with silence 
 penned up between the sea and sadness 
 between two motionless 
 between the lips and the voice something goes dying 
 something with the wings of a bird something of anguish and oblivion 
 the way nets can not hold water 
 my toy doll only a few drops are left trembling 
 even so something sings in these fugitive words 
 something sings something climbs to my ravenous mouth 
 oh to be able to celebrate you with all the words of joy 
 sing burn flee like a belfry at the hands of a madman 
 my sad tenderness what comes over you all at once when i have reached the most awesome and the coldest summit my heart closes like a nocturnal flower 
 every day you play every day you play with the light of the universe 
 subtle visitor you arrive in the flower and the water 
 you are more that this white head that i hold tightly as a cluster of fruit every day between my hands 
 you are like nobody since i love you 
 let me spread you out among the yellow 
 who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south oh let me remember you as you were before you existed 
 suddenly the wind howls and bangs my shut window 
 the sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish 
 here all the winds will let go sooner or later all of them 
 the rain takes off her clothes 
 the birds go by fleeing 
 the wind 
 the wind 
 i can contend only against the power of men 
 the storm dark leaves and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to the sky 
 you are here 
 oh you do not run away 
 you will answer me to the last cry 
 cling to me as though you were frightened 
 even so at one time a strange shadow ran through your eyes 
 now now too little one you bring me honeysuckle and even your breasts smell of it 
 while the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies i love you and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth 
 how you must have suffered against getting accustomed to me my savage solitary soul my name that sends them all running 
 so many times have we seen the morning star burn kissing our eyes and over our heads the grey light in turning fans 
 my words rained over you stroking you 
 a long time i have loved the of your body 
 i go so far as to think you own the universe 
 i will bring you happy flowers from the mountains dark and rustic baskets of kisses 
 i want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees 
 i like for you to be still i like for you to be still i as though you were absent and you do not hear me far away and my voice does not touch you 
 it seems as though your eyes had flown away and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth as all things are filled with my soul you emerge from the things filled with my soul 
 you are like my soul a butterfly of dream and you are like the word melancholy 
 i like for you to be still and you are still far away 
 it sounds as though you were a butterfly cooing like a dove 
 and you hear me from far away and my voice does not reach you let me come to be still in you silence 
 and let me talk to you with your silence that is bright as a lamp simple as a ring 
 you are like the night with its stillness and constellations 
 your silence is that of a star as remote and candid 
 i like for you to be still it is though you were absent distant and full of sorrow as though you had died 
 one word then one smile is enough 
 and i am happy happy that its not true 
 in my sky as twilight in my sky at twilight you are like a cloud and your form and are the way i love them 
 you are mine mine woman with sweet lips and in your life my infinite dreams live 
 the lamp of my soul your feet 
 my sour wine is sweeter than your lips oh of my evening song how solitary dreams believe you to be mine you are mine mine i go shouting it to the afternoon wind and the wind hauls on my widowed voice 
 of the depths of my eyes your plunder stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water 
 you are taken in the net of my music my love and my nets of music are wide as the sky 
 my soul is borne on the shore of your eyes of mourning in your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begins 
 thinking shadows thinking shadows in the deep solitude 
 you are far away too oh farther than anyone 
 thinking freeing birds dissolving images lamps 
 belfry of how far away up there stifling laments milling shadowy hopes night falls on you face downward far from the city 
 your presence is foreign as strange as a thing 
 i think i explore great tracts of my life before you 
 my life before anyone my harsh life 
 the shout facing the sea among the rocks running free mad in the 
 the sad rage the shout the solitude of the sea 
 violent stretched towards the sky 
 you woman what were you there what ray what of that immense fan you were as far as you are now 
 fire in the forest burn in blue crosses 
 burn burn flame up sparkle in trees of light 
 it collapses crackling 
 fire 
 fire 
 and my soul dances with curls of fire 
 who calls what silence peopled with echoes hour of nostalgia hour of happiness hour of solitude hour that is mine from among them all hunting horn through which the wind passes singing 
 such a passion of weeping tied to my body 
 shaking of all the roots attack of all the waves my soul wandered happy sad unending 
 thinking lamps in the deep solitude 
 who are you who are you here i love you here i love you 
 in the dark pines the wind itself 
 the moon glows like phosphorus on the vagrant waters 
 days all one kind go chasing each other 
 the snow in dancing figures 
 a silver gull slips down from the west 
 sometimes a sail 
 high high stars 
 oh the black cross of a ship 
 alone 
 sometimes i get up early and my soul is wet 
 far away the sea sounds and resounds 
 this is a port 
 here i love you 
 here i love you and the horizon hides you in vain 
 i love you still among these cold things 
 sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels that cross the sea towards no arrival 
 i see myself forgotten like those old anchors 
 the piers when the afternoon moors there 
 my life grows tired hungry to no purpose 
 i love what i do not have 
 you are so far 
 my loathing wrestles with the slow 
 but night comes on and starts to sing to me 
 the moon turns its clockwork dream 
 the biggest stars look at me with your eyes 
 and as i love you the pines in the wind want to sing your name with their leaves of wire 
 girl lithe and tawny girl lithe and tawny the sun that forms the fruits that the grains that curls filled your body with joy and your luminous eyes and your mouth that has the smile of water 
 a black yearning sun is braided into the strands of your black when you stretch your arms 
 you play with the sun as with a little brook and it leaves two dark pools in your eyes 
 girl lithe and tawny nothing draws me towards you 
 everything bears me farther away as though you were noon 
 you are the frenzied youth of the bee the drunkenness of the wave the power of the 
 my somber heart searches for you nevertheless and i love your joyful body your slender and flowing voice 
 dark butterfly sweet and definitive like the and the sun the poppy and the water 
 tonight i can write tonight i can write the lines 
 write for example the night is and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance 
 the night wind revolves in the sky and sings 
 tonight i can write the lines 
 i loved her and sometimes she loved me too 
 through nights like this one i held her in my arms 
 i kissed her again and again under the endless sky 
 she loved me and sometimes i loved her too 
 how could i not have loved her great still eyes 
 tonight i can write the lines 
 to think that i do not have her 
 to feel that i have lost her 
 to hear the immense night still more immense without her 
 and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture 
 what does it matter that my love could not keep her 
 the night is and she is not with me 
 this is all 
 in the distance someone is singing 
 in the distance 
 my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her 
 my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer my heart looks for her and she is not with me 
 the same night whitening the same trees 
 we of that time are no longer the same 
 i no longer love her for certain but how i loved her 
 my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing 
 
 she will be 
 as she was before my kisses 
 her voice her bright body 
 her infinite eyes 
 i am no longer in love with her certain but maybe i love her 
 love is so short forgetting is so long 
 because through nights like this one i held her in my arms my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her 
 though this be the last pain she makes me suffer and these the last verses that i write for her 
 the song of despair the memory of you emerges from the night around me 
 the river mingles in its stubborn lament with the sea 
 deserted like the wharves at dawn 
 it is the hour of departure oh deserted one cold flower heads are raining in my heart 
 oh pit of debris fierce cave of the shipwrecked 
 in you the wars and the flights accumulated from you the wings of the song birds rose 
 you swallowed everything like distance 
 like the sea like time 
 in you everything sank it was the happy hour of assault and the kiss 
 the hour of the spell that blazed like a 
 pilots dread fury of a blind driver turbulent drunkenness of love in you everything sank 
 in the childhood of mist my soul winged and wounded 
 lost discoverer in you everything sank you sorrow you clung to desire sadness stunned you in you everything sank i made the wall of shadow draw back beyond desire and act i walked on 
 oh flesh my own flesh woman that i loved and lost i summon you in the moist hour i raise my song to you 
 like a jar you housed the infinite tenderness and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar 
 there was the black solitude of the islands and there woman of love your arms took me in 
 there were thirst and hunger and you were the fruit 
 there were grief and ruins and you were the miracle 
 ah woman i do not know how you could contain me in the earth of your soul in the cross of your arms how horrible and brief was my desire of you how difficult and drunken how tensed and avid 
 cemetery of kisses there is still fire in your tombs still the boughs burn pecked at by birds 
 oh the bitter mouth oh the kissed limbs oh the teeth oh the entwined bodies 
 oh the mad coupling of hope and force in which we merged and 
 and the tenderness light as water and as flour 
 and the word scarcely begun on the lips 
 this was my destiny and in it was the voyage of my longing and in it my longing fell in you everything sank 
 oh pit of debris everything fell into you what sorrow did you not express in what sorrow are you not drowned from to you still called and sang 
 standing like a sailor on the prow of the vessel 
 you still flowered in songs you still broke in currents 
 oh pit of debris open and bitter well 
 pale blind diver lost discoverer in you everything sank it is the hour of departure the hard cold hour in which the night fastens to all timetables 
 the rustling belt of the sea the shore 
 cold stars heave up black birds migrate 
 deserted like the wharves at dawn 
 only the shadow twists in my hands 
 oh farther than everything 
 oh farther than everything 
 it is the hour of departure 
 oh abandoned one it was many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me 
 i was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love i and my with a love that the of heaven coveted her and me 
 and this was the reason that long ago in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud chilling my beautiful so that her came and bore her away from me to shut her up in a in this kingdom by the sea 
 the angels not half so happy in heaven went her and me was the reason as all men know in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night chilling and killing my 
 but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever my soul from the soul of the beautiful for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes of the beautiful and so all the i lie down by the side of my life and my bride in her there by the sea in her tomb by the sounding sea
