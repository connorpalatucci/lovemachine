let us go then you and i 
when the evening is spread out against the sky  
like a patient etherized upon a table 
let us go through certain halfdeserted streets  
the muttering retreats          
of restless nights in onenight cheap hotels 
and sawdust restaurants with oystershells  
streets that follow like a tedious argument  
of insidious intent  
to lead you to an overwhelming question         
oh do not ask what is it 
let us go and make our visit 
in the room the women come and go   
talking of michelangelo   
 garden of bliss where fairest flowers are culled   
    rich mine of treasures wanting no bright gem 
serpentless eden of a blessd pair 
    best jewel in a lifes bright diadem 
hence with the thought of shame to him who deems           
there was a damned successful poet 
  there was a woman like the sun   
and they were dead they did not know it 
  they did not know their time was done  
  they did not know his hymns         
  were silence and her limbs   
  that had served love so well  
  dust and a filthy smell   
  that silence again
             a wall
of feathers and near
enough
            to block the
circuit of our time
adobe wall
           roads of dust
thirty two years
until the bones
            discoursed
thats how long
ive dug into
            myself
and the baby
she is a promise
            ungraspable
mist
fuss or no fuss
           yearn yearn
yearn heart

 am walks on fridays across the maraisfrom that insomniac
bar on rue de lappe via a place des vosges gurgling secrets
in her sleep zagging down to rue du roi de sicile before
zigging back to the tip of rue des francsbourgeois
sound asleep with pit stops to salute gothic
gargoyles brush art deco faades and peer
at miniature parks penned in for the night
then up boulevard de sbastopol up north
all the way north to your shared digs
in chteau rouge holding a wasted
bedraggled moon aloft turn by

to the last clean fitted sheet
at the prematurely aged laundrette
rasping out wrong or no change on the top
floor was it or does memory begin to fray of
rsidence andr allix high above the funicular station
at saintjuste vieux lyon some years later the same ritual
with the swankier snootier machines in chteaulandon paris
claiming more coins the tortuous rides you would take to reach
each timebefore id begin to fold the cobalt nakshi kantha
quilt you had brought back from a fair trade crafts village
near the northern suburbs of dhaka that you knew
i should trip overeach timeif left alone that
quilt still alive still untorn strangers tend
to help most keen to touch to stroke
the wealth of colors to ask where
is itare you from one came
home the other day 
vernal
morningwalk
battles simmering
from the night before
wildfiring pyring by the axis
of parc josaphat in schaerbeek
our voices scorching the sleepfilled
wings of the neighboring swans and
wordsboth barbed and burningwhirl
pooling the ponds beneath their feet then all
of itthe earth the air the green that high blaze
of words and decibels yes everythingunspooling
in a snarl of arms and thighs hips and groins extralarge
elbows tongues andit once even feltuncaged ribs with
double smelted hearts purplehot beneath and hammering their
own daft arrhythmic anthem overheard only by an inquiring fox
 if you must hear      the story
of my turbulent gaze      after waking
the march of my hours      to hermit
into a higher body      it is that
whatever you put            into the universe
eventually       returns
in our oneness      of gift
                     we are eyes together
nerves together         affected together
if ive never      told you
how madly we share      in the stars
how it was all      founded      for you
then let the longing      for arcturus
                     be the gilding      of our sleep
i know      when your time      was in its
making      i was left      to sing alone
unfed      to trample through      a hundred
layers      of night      without a heart
                                   to hold my guard
these are all ancient names of what you will once call home
the shape of the fire altar is independent of time
hen death fell asleep between my legs
one arm slung over my knee
i pulled her up to my leaking breasts
and heard her grind her teeth
does not inhabit herself
stun guns of solar hair and eye flash hide her age
born in a mirror in water precariously unheld
will never die
sometimes runeface spreads
wind wrinkling a lake
dolphins flipping at eyes and mouth
sometimes a crucifix
nose the bent of spine
splayed veins from eyebolts
a bit inconvenient
to die just to drop
this sticky lover
that loveless parent
if only one could just get plastic surgery
change lives behind the shrubbery
not fair
i get older so
do you i
never catch
up you train me
for your death
to my patterns you do
patterns i want something
to shock you
my namesake tree
to drop all its leaves
in the center of spring
remind me what
i gain by being here
love me in a hurry

i ran across the street i didnt know any better
ran out in the street i didnt know no better
i just knew a woman was there though id never met her
she sat me in her parlor distracted me with trinkets
milky glass birds and fish distracting trinkets
she said my mother would be fine but did she think it
the world was a blur of crystal wings and fins
my tears were casked in crystal wings and fins
she was the first of many ladyfriends
the tree shadows shortened she brought me a drink of water
morning matured she brought me a glass of water
i drank it so fast she went and brought another
i kept looking out the window she didnt ask me what for
i watched out that window she didnt ask what for
the seconds broke off and lay there on the floor
i imagined my mothers route as far as i could
her long morning walk followed as far as i could
nothing i could do would do any good
suffer the little children and forbid them not
christ said suffer the little children and forbid them not

songs like crystals lining up to kiss the bell that says big

everyone hot in their coats paid for not stolen they
admit to being too late for miracles for charity the
poems parents are in the front row the poems friend
interprets can we repeat it without going back to the
start the lovers demand like ants beneath the plaint
in eden in athens estrangement flowers we turn and
return is it love itself beckoning from the lurid grass

ground they fly like lucy you can deny it all for fun
and parties as if the mind was the feeling that input
gives its a power no one likes to admit as it so often
leads to failure in later life like living in a swimming
pool or losing your tongue in the mail what of
romances with characters from books alice says hello
dear sip dear shotgun dear pound
beneath the house the kegs roll in
the party flips its switches down
when drunk comes it comes as sound
a chord a liftoff i ride the rim
dear sip dear shotgun dear pound
he could be anyone and he abounds
i slip inside a dance with him
the party flips its switches down
lets go he says upstairs now
my cup spills my shirt is skin
ut all i want to do is marry them on a beach
that refuses to take itself too seriously
so much of our lives has been serious
over time ive learned that love is most astonishing
when it persists after learning where we come from
when i bring my partner to my childhood home
it is all bullets and needles and trash bags held
at arms length it is my estranged fathers damp
bed of cardboard and cigar boxes filled
with gauze and tarnished spoons it is hard
to clean a home but it is harder to clean
the memory of it when i was young my
father would light lavender candles and shoot
up now my partner and i light a fire that will
burn all traces of the family that lived here
black plastic smoke curdles up and loose bullets
discharge in the flames my partner holds
my hand as gunfire rings through
the birch trees though this is almost
from up here in the leaves nokidding goldishness
youd guess everyone was already in lovely w each
others cheekbones infinity scarves
 vanilla coffee mint tea warm whatever
cozy becoming the comingattheseams a couplet
of verbs midbodily inexperience
that man doing cartwheels is not wearing a shirt
 in any other life id want to be the double dare
fanfaring a future so totally astonished
by his nipples this is what i mean
when i say things like catastrophe
okay fine just one more winter
nothing can compare anymore to us anymore
you big good oak limb im in such cute like w you today
in one diary of my havebeens my mother

mothers you god particle you matrilineage
ive never lived anywhere more
or less this haunted she named my sister
elizabeth you boy
genius you midsummer pinky promise ring
theres this person i know im not in love w but wears
a dress patterned like a postcard from the state my grandma
died in imagine waking up
a whole frame away from your bedsheets imagine
waking up  being anything as yellow
as a dress you treeline you root song whats an amount
of time equal
to you you kindling ring finger you unchewable bark
but the headaches gone pardon me dandelions
have you seen my ghost six foot nothing
has an interstate for a mother but also a mother adjust
your spurs honeybunch this time im writing all of us
in pink ink lets hucklebuckle off into the leafiest
of all possible genderings you know how the rain
starts right after you get home  the country song
your friend slowdanced w her big love to the one
your mom would play real quiet on her moonbeam
highway streak back to pensacola is somehow
already at the chorus  you forget there are words like joy
or when someone whispers imagine you never met them
back at the bum grinning stars you remember
its like that
or is that the difference between salt  salt a someday
of matching sweaters
told you its cute o sweaters o little knit
bundles of vegetablespit its always sunsetting
you golden hour you soapsoft seasonal
once my mom found me
sitting in a circle of candles touching each rosebud
 sat w me until we were wax musuems
of our secrets look
the skys a toenail  the moons a chesthair all the shirtless
boys have tired themself out spreadeagled
 slapping the sun off their shoulder blades my body is a line
heading for my body you crushedgrass
sex smell you dirtinverted comma someone w bleached
hair is biking home to restud their denim
i rediscovered kissing foreheads  it is so yes again
hurry up  sunspot daylilies
the cops arent going to awe themselves
to death  we have
a dictionary to laugh across
by going you have to be and
seek it
said the starlet in the shared volitional language of space and time
explanation thrashes round the thing but doesnt touch it
the thing we know then as style of thrashing or
ripples in the pond sufficient
in itself she licks her tongue it could be desired as a figure
faithless as a class of examples
i found new objects swimming blankly in a common
sense by going alone to listen
                                                to them
                         in the night
            light of their pool
 oh yet one smile tho dark may lower 
around thee clouds of woe and ill 
let me yet feel that i have power 
mid fates bleak storms to soothe thee still 
tho sadness be upon thy brow 
yet let it turn dear love to me 
i cannot bear that thou shouldst know 
sorrow i do not share with thee 
true loves wreath is of mountain flowers 
they stand the storm and brave the blast 
and blossom on so love like ours 
is sweetest when all else is past 
too well i know what storms have frowned 
and now frown on lifes troubled tide 
still darker let them gather round 
they have no power on hearts so tried 
then say not that you may not bear 
to shadow spirit light as mine 
i shall not shrink or fear to share 
the darkest fate if it be thine
oh say not love was never made 
for heart so light as mine 
must love then seek the cypress shade 
rear but a gloomy shrine 
oh say not that for me more meet 
the revelry of youth 
or that my wild heart cannot beat 
with deep devoted truth 
tho mirth may many changes ring 
tis but an outward show 
even upon the fond doves wing 
will varying colours glow 
light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
and sparkle oer my brow 
tis but the glisten of the stream 
that hides the gold below 
tis love that gilds the mirthful hour 
that lights the smile for me 
those smiles would instant lose their power 
did they not glance on thee
oh come to my slumber 
sweet dreams of my love 
i have hung the charmed wreath 
my soft pillow above 
the roses are linked 
in a chain pure and white 
and the roseleaves are wet 
with the dew drops of night 
the moon was on high 
as i gatherd each flower 
the dew that then falls 
has a magical power 
the spirit of slumber 
those roses has blest 
and sweet are the visions 
theyll bring to my rest 
be their spell on my soul 
so they let me but see 
his dark eyes flash in love 
and his smile glance on me 
let sleep bring the image 
of him far away 
tis worth all the tears 
i shed for him by day 
i have hung the charmed wreath 
my soft pillow above 
then come to my slumber 
sweet dreams of my love
how vain to cast my love away 
on bosom false as thine 
the flowerets bloom that springs in may 
would be a safer shrine 
to build my fondest hopes upon 
tho fragile it may be 
that flowers smile is not sooner gone 
than love that trusts to thee 
love asks a calm a gentle home 
or else its life is oer 
if once you let its pinions roam 
oh then tis love no more 
the aspins changefui shade can be 
no shelter for the dove 
and hearts as varying as that tree 
are sure no place for love 
hope lingerd long and anxiously 
oer failing faith but now 
i give thee back each heartless sigh 
give back each broken vow 
ill trust the stay of tulip dyes 
the calm of yon wild sea 
the sunshine of the april skies 
but never more to thee 
oh would that love had power to raise 
a little isle for us alone 
with fairy flowers and sunny rays 
the blue sea wave its guardian zone 
no other step should ever press 
this hidden eden of the heart 
and we would share its loveliness 
from every other thing apart 
the rose and violet should weep 
wheneer our leafy couch was laid 
the lark should wake our morning sleep 
the bulbul sing our serenade 
f it became impossible to touch and be touched to see
and be seen to love and trade ecstasy for risk where risk
is ecstasy to be hidden in plain view to be perfectly lost
which means lost to the world lying sidebyside arms linked
in a bond so intricate it could never unfold or break
if it became crucial to live out of sight to be housebound
to walk a beaten path in the garden to sit at the window
blurred by rainfall to sit barred and blocked books
set aside that would never be read rolling news of flash flood
and fire angels treading the updraft a chaos of voices
if dreams should give the rest of it the path in the garden
going underground flood and fire as gods only gift
the house holding its secrets that pattern of locked rooms
what lies outside voices angels crowding the perimeter
you could make an installation of it
and why not on a bare floor
in a bare hall under neon strip
what seems thrown down what seems
heap after heap of discards but is not
hair and shoes and spectacles
and clothes teeth also saved
repetition such that it blurs
images folding into one another
abstract just shape being evident
except this shoe except
this lens catching the light which is
error or artifact something like
iron litter carefully thrown down
by joseph beuys but more the bright
grotesque of bacons fragment
of dubuffets larbre de fluides
whats torn whats wrenched apart
heap after heap grainy footage
of a cattle train snowscape
smokestacks scratch orchestra what
more do you needdogswhat more
do you need of this the train
all but silent in snow footage
of carcasses thrown down naked
you could make a montage of it
quick hands a low sun deepening
to yellow by trees and towers
the way shadows are cast the light
you need the shapes you need
a sureness of touch to bring it all
together perhaps a light box
fragments and fractures backlit
and all of a piece not least
the new dead they lie
in a scatter your focal point
they make sudden broken
angels in the snow
fool steps up his art is palimpsest
hell tag your work spraypaint
a ditzy orange bugeyed frog
at the door of the charnel house
color the snowscape blue redact
the chimneys configure the train
with silverandblack chevrons
a snake drawn up to the iron gate
his artwork evil is as evil does
the frog spits bile the snake
is holloweyed he adds
speech bubbles to the cold still air
hosanna hosanna hosanna
 when the air shaped like the inverse of megan
accepts megan as she moves
    if megan is a system of exchange
that floats her labor and her point
  of view in vaporliquid soup
passging through her valves
and if her later corpse collapsing
 updates its inversion of the air
 even more than did the air displace
when she grew from browneyed baby
into strong laboring woman in blue jeans
  and heathered wool
and if the air and earth draw from megans corpse
  all the energy and minerals
 she pulled from her surrounds
to build her nails and bones and teeth
 if the exchange doesnt stop
but only ceases to support her consciousness
 and if her consciousness was corpse anyway until
it found relation
 then what demises
is the potential for the human social
and another sociality
 will unbutton my whole shoe
and tongue hang limp
  what sex is for but stops me
 at the barrier a pixelated
glamour reef though very
   close and simple smell a
  flurry parapluie paraphrase
 energy funneled through a shape
you filtered chemical
 information in such a pointy
fulgent scrambled way in the city
i thought i had lost myself
but i see its you thats gone missing
o always elsewhere
what yacht or spaceship have you hijacked
in what seedy hideaway do you scoff
at the sameness of all cities all ideas
once you made me loquacious
because whats the point in saying anything
if there isnt the possibility of being misunderstood
now i am nearly speechless with boredom
i will wait madame butterflystyle for your return
light falls from her voice
and i try to catch it as the last
light of the day fades
but there is no form to touch
no pain to trace
are dreams
taking their seats
on the night train
she recites a list of wishes
to keep him from dying
the truth lands like a kiss
sometimes like a mosquito
sometimes like a lantern
your coffeecolored skin
awakens me to the world
we have only one minute
and i love you
all children are poets
until they quit the habit
of reaching for butterflies
that are not there
the moment you thought you lost me
you saw me clearly
with all of my flowers
even the dried ones
if you pronounce all letters
and vowels at once
you would hear their names
falling drop by drop
with the rain
we carved
our ancestral trees into boats
the boats sailed into harbors
that looked safe from afar
trees talk to each other
like old friends
and dont like to be interrupted
they follow anyone who
cuts one of them
turning that person
into a lonely cut branch
is this why in arabic
we say cut of a tree
when we mean
having no one
the way roots hide
under trees
there are secrets
faces and wind
behind the colors
in rothkos untitled canvases
will the sea forget its waves
as caves forgot us
back when there was no language
they walked until sunset
carrying red leaves
like words to remember
its true that pain
is like air available
everywhere
but we each feel
our pain hurts the most
so many of them died
under stars
that dont know their names
if she just survived with me
a flame dims in the fireplace
a day slips quietly away from the calendar
and fairuz sings they say love kills time
and they also say time kills love
the street vendor offers tourists
necklaces with divided hearts
seashells to murmur the seas secrets in your ear
squishy balls to make you feel better
maps of homelands you fold
in your pocket as you go on your way
of many reasons i love you here is one
the way you write me from the gate at the airport
so i can tell you everything will be alright
so you can tell me there is a bird
trapped in the terminal      all the people
ignoring it       because they do not know
what to do with it       except to leave it alone
until it scares itself to death
it makes you terribly terribly sad
you wish you could take the bird outside
and set it free or       failing that
call a birdunderstander
to come help the bird
the shine on her buckle took precedence in sun
her shine i should say could take me anywhere
it feels right to be up this close in tight wind
it feels right to notice all the shiny things about you
about you there is nothing i wouldnt want to know
with you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler
about you many good things come into relation
i think of proofs and grammar vowel sounds like
a is for knee socks e for panties
i is for buttondown o the blouse you wear
u is for hair clip and y your tight skirt
the music picks up again i am the man i hope to be
the bright air hangs freely near your newly cut hair
it is so easy now to see gravity at work in your face
easy to understand time that dark process
to accept it as a beautiful process your face
guy calls the doctor says the wifes   
contractions are five minutes apart   
doctor says is this her first child
guy says no its her husband
i promise to try to remember who   
i am wife gets up on one elbow
says i wanted to get married   
it seemed a fulfillment of some
several things a thing to be done   
even the diamond ring was some
thing like a quest a thing they   
set you out to get and how insane
the quest is how you have to turn   
it every way before you can even
think to seek it this metaphysical   
refraining is in fact the quest whod
waking
on the train i thought   
we were attacked
it has been so wet stones glaze in moss
everything blooms coldly
cherry plums suck a weeks soak
overnight they explode into the scenery of before
your touch the curtains open on the end of our past
pink trumpets on the vines bare to the hummingbirds
butterflies unclasp from the purse of their couplings they
light and open on the doubled hands of eucalyptus fronds
they sip from the pistils for seven generations that bear
them through another tongue as the first year of our
punishing mathematic begins clicking the calendar
forward they land like seasoned rocks on the
decks of the cliffs they take another turn
on the spiral of life where the blossoms
blush  pale in a day of dirty dawn
where the ghost of you webs
your limbs through branches
of cherry plum rare bird
extinct color you stay in
my dreams in xray in
rerun the bone of you
stripping sweethearts
folds and layers the
shedding petals of
my grief into a
decayed holo
there is a hornet in the room   
and one of us will have to go   
out the window into the late   
august midafternoon sun i
won there is a certain challenge   
in being humane to hornets   
but not much a launch draws   
two lines of wake behind it   
on the bay like a delta
with a melted base sandy   
billows or so they look
of feathery ripe heads of grass   
an acidyellow kind of
goldenrod glowing or glowering   
in shade rocks with rags   
of shadow washed dust clouts   
that will never bleach
it is not like this at all   
the rapid running of the   
lapping water a hollow knock
of someone shipping oars   
its eleven years since   
frank sat at this desk and   
saw and heard it all   
the incessant water the   
immutable crickets only   
not the same new needles   
on the spruce new seaweed   
on the lowtide rocks   
other grass and other water   
even the great gold lichen   
on a granite boulder   
even the boulder quite   
literally is not the same
      ii
a day subtle and suppressed   
in mounds of juniper enfolding   
scratchy pockets of shadow
while bignessrocks trees a stump
stands shadowless in an overcast   
of ripe grass there is nothing   
but shade like the boggy depths   
of a stand of spruce its resonance   
just the thin scream
of mosquitoes ascending
boats are light lumps on the bay   
stretching past erased islands   
to ocean and the terrible tumble   
and london rain persisting   
and paris changing to rain   
delicate day setting the bright
of a young spruce against the cold
of an old one hung with unripe cones   
each exuding at its tip
gum pungent clear as a tear   
a day tarnished and fractured   
as the quartz in the rocks
of a dulled and distant point   
a day like a gull passing
with a slow flapping of wings   
in a kind of lope without
breeze enough to shake loose   
the last of the fireweed flowers
a faintly clammy day like wet silk   
stained by one dead branch   
the harsh russet of dried blood
grammy
for ever
empty
art
i expect you i thought one night it was you
at the base of the drive you at the foot of the stairs
you in a shiver of light but each time
leaves in wind revealed themselves
the retreating shadow of a fox daybreak
we expect you cat and i bluebirds and i the stove
in may we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires
over which young men and women leapt
june efforts quietly
ive planted vegetables along each garden wall
so even if spring continues to disappoint
we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain
i have new gloves and a new hoe
i practice eulogies he was a hawk
with white feathered legs she had the quiet ribs
of a salamander crossing the old pony post road
yours is the name the leaves chatter
at the edge of the unrabbited woods
            by light   
chromewinged birds   
for the first time i listen to a lost
and secret recording of us
making love nearon ten years ago
i recognize your voice your sounds
though if i knew no better
i could be any man in any room
after the rising sounds of rising
and of dressing and once
as you step up close to the deck
perhaps to pick up shoes you sing
the chorus of sunday morning
i call on you to hurry and we leave
it does not end then the tape rolls on
a few late cars which sigh by
might have passed us walking away
triumphant unaware weve left behind
this mop and mow mechanism
of silence to which we may never return
the day is gone and all its sweets are gone 
sweet voice sweet lips soft hand and softer breast 
warm breath light whisper tender semitone 
bright eyes accomplishd shape and langrous waist 
faded the flower and all its budded charms 
faded the sight of beauty from my eyes 
faded the shape of beauty from my arms 
faded the voice warmth whiteness paradise  
vanishd unseasonably at shut of eve 
when the dusk holiday  or holinight 
of fragrantcurtaind love begins to weave 
the woof of darkness thick for hid delight 
but as ive read loves missal through today 
hell let me sleep seeing i fast and pray 
hatching from the lagoon
            that first day   
the buoys were all   
that made the harbor
            bearable
pennies sewn into a hemline   
later i learned to live in it
            to walk
through the alien city
a beekeepers habit
            with fierce light   
clinging to my head and hands   
treated as gently as every
            other guest
each houses barbed antennae   
trawling for any kind
            of weather
still i sobbed in a glass box   
on an unswept street
            with the last
few lire ticking like fleas
off my phonecard im sorry
            i cant
stand this which
one of us do you love
have guessed she sighs i like   
the predictability of two i like
you did not come 
and marching time drew on and wore me numb 
yet less for loss of your dear presence there 
than that i thus found lacking in your make 
that high compassion which can overbear 
reluctance for pure lovingkindness sake 
grieved i when as the hopehour stroked its sum 
you did not come 
you love not me 
and love alone can lend you loyalty 
i know and knew it but unto the store 
of human deeds divine in all but name 
was it not worth a little hour or more 
to add yet this once you a woman came 
to soothe a timetorn man even though it be 
you love not me 
my pleasures fully expected   
when the expectation of them
somewhere or other there must surely be 
the face not seen the voice not heard 
the heart that not yetnever yetah me 
made answer to my word 
somewhere or other may be near or far 
past land and sea clean out of sight 
beyond the wandering moon beyond the star 
that tracks her night by night 
somewhere or other may be far or near 
with just a wall a hedge between 
with just the last leaves of the dying year 
fallen on a turf grown green 
grows patterned in its steady   
surprise ive got my sweet
take oh take those lips away 
that so sweetly were forsworn 
and those eyes like break of day 
lights that do mislead the morn 
but my kisses bring again 
seals of love though sealed in vain 
hide oh hide those hills of snow 
which thy frozen bosom bears 
on whose tops the pinks that grow 
are of those that april wears 
but first set my poor heart free 
bound in those icy chains by thee
and tumble pat here on earth   
i like to count upon a thing
through your lens the sequoia swallowed me   
like a dryad the camera flashed  forgot
i on the other hand must practice my absent
mindedness memory being awkward as a touch   
that goes unloved lately your eyes have shut
down to a shade more durable than skins i know you   
love distance how it smooths you choose an aerial view   
the city angled to abstraction while i go for the close   
exposures poorlymounted countenances along broadway   
the pigweed cracking each hardscrabble backlot   
its a matter of perspective yours is to love me   
from a block away  mine is to praise the grain
iness that weaves expressively your face
things happen when you drink too much mescal
one night with not enough food in my belly
he kept on buying   im a girl wholl fall
damn near in love with gratitude and well he
was hot and generous and so the least
that i could do was let him kiss me hard
and soft and any way you want it beast
and beauty lime and saltsweet bacchus pards
and when his friend showed up i felt so warm
and generous i let him kiss me too
his buddy asked me if it was the worm
inside that makes me do the things i do
i wasnt sure which worm he meant the one
i ate   the one that eats at me alone
like that thus explained   
the woman in contractions
to her lover holding on
the telephone for the doctor
to recover from this strange   
conversational turn you say
youre whom it is a pleasure   
to meet you she rolls her
eyes but hed once asked her   
am i your first lover and shed   
said could be your face looks   
familiar its the same type of
generative error the grammar
of the spoken word will flip let alone
the written until something new is   
in us and in our conversation
i loved you first but afterwards your love
outsoaring mine sang such a loftier song
as drowned the friendly cooings of my dove
which owes the other most my love was long
and yours one moment seemed to wax more strong
i loved and guessed at you you construed me
and loved me for what might or might not be 
nay weights and measures do us both a wrong
for verily love knows not mine or thine
with separate i and thou free love has done
for one is both and both are one in love
rich love knows nought of thine that is not mine
both have the strength and both the length thereof
both of us of the love which makes us one
you have changed me already i am a fireball
that is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
you can choose not to look up but i am a giant orange ball
that is throwing sparks upon your face
oh look at them shake
upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
o too this is so dramatic this shaking
of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
so you ran and hid
under a large tree she was graceful i think
that tree although soon she will wither
into ten black snakes upon your throat
and when she does i will be wandering as i always am
a graceful lady that is part museum
of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
i will hold your voice in a little box
and when you come upon me i wont look back at you
you will feel a hand upon your heart while i place your voice back
into the heart from where it came from
and i will not cry also
although you will expect me to
i was wiser too than you had expected
for i knew all along you were mine
you are like me you will die too but not today   
you incommensurate therefore the hours shine   
if i say to you to you i say you have not been   
set to music or broadcast live on the ghost   
radio may never be an oil painting or
old masters charcoal sketch you are
a concordance of person number voice
and place strawberries spread through your name   
as if it were budding shrubs how you remind me   
of some spring the waters as cool and clear
late rain clings to your leaves shaken by light wind   
which is where you occur in grassy moonlight   
and you are a lily an aster white trillium
or viburnum by all rights mine white star   
in the meadow sky the snow still arriving
from its earthwards journeys here where there is   
no snow i dreamed the snow was you
when there was snow you are my right
have come to be my night your body takes on   
the dimensions of sleep the shape of sleep   
becomes you and you fall from the sky
with several flowers words spill from your mouth
in waves your lips taste like the sea saltsweet trees   
and seas have flown away i call it
loving you home is nowhere therefore you   
a kind of dwell and welcome song after all   
and free of any eden we can name
all you can do is notice the bird
and feel for the bird       and write
to tell me how language feels
impossibly useless
  busy old fool unruly sun
               why dost thou thus
through windows and through curtains call on us
must to thy motions lovers seasons run
               saucy pedantic wretch go chide
               late school boys and sour prentices
         go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride
         call country ants to harvest offices
love all alike no season knows nor clime
nor hours days months which are the rags of time
drink to me only with thine eyes 
         and i will pledge with mine 
or leave a kiss but in the cup 
         and ill not look for wine 
the thirst that from the soul doth rise 
         doth ask a drink divine 
but might i of joves nectar sup 
         i would not change for thine 
take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbry gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear loves wrong than hates known injury
    lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
    kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
i sent thee late a rosy wreath 
         not so much honouring thee 
as giving it a hope that there 
         it could not withered be 
but thou thereon didst only breathe 
         and sentst it back to me 
since when it grows and smells i swear 
         not of itself but thee
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality oersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summers honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of battring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
   o none unless this miracle have might
   that in black ink my love may still shine bright
               thy beams so reverend and strong
               why shouldst thou think
i could eclipse and cloud them with a wink
but that i would not lose her sight so long
               if her eyes have not blinded thine
               look and tomorrow late tell me
         whether both th indias of spice and mine
         be where thou leftst them or lie here with me
ask for those kings whom thou sawst yesterday
and thou shalt hear all here in one bed lay
               shes all states and all princes i
               nothing else is
princes do but play us compared to this
all honors mimic all wealth alchemy
               thou sun art half as happy as we
               in that the worlds contracted thus
         thine age asks ease and since thy duties be
         to warm the world thats done in warming us
shine here to us and thou art everywhere
this bed thy center is these walls thy sphere
but you are wrong
if ever two were one then surely we
if ever man were loved by wife then thee
if ever wife was happy in a man
compare with me ye women if you can
i prize thy love more than whole mines of gold
or all the riches that the east doth hold
my love is such that rivers cannot quench
nor ought but love from thee give recompense
thy love is such i can no way repay
the heavens reward thee manifold i pray
then while we live in love lets so persever
that when we live no more we may live ever
you are a birdunderstander
better than i could ever be
who make so many noises
and call them song
these are your own words
your way of noticing
and saying plainly
of not turning away
from hurt
you have offered them
to me       i am only
giving them back
if only i could show you
how very useless
they are not
i am haunted by the melody
of a forgotten song
sung while two hands
tied my shoelaces into a ribbon
and waved me goodbye to school
if i could photocopy
the moment we met
i would find it full
of all the days and nights
it wont forget the faraway child
that city whose door stayed open
for passersby tourists and invaders
the moon is going to the other
side of the world
to call my loved ones
the seasons change
colors and you come and go
what color is your departure
    and outside the city in the vernal zones
   and aqua zones the city shaped flowcharted realist
 trucked the city caved under
     when the zones rose and lapped around the pilings
 manged foundations green
      rotted the teeth out of the mouth of the city
 harbor highrises
dark and blown the city is extremely fragile tender
 human mesh and will be mush
    and mushrooms grow in there is room in ruins
roam the rearticulated harm
speech by a flaneurno a flaneuse
on my face d folliculorum are relaxing
 like tenniel caterpillars leaning on mushroom stalks
  against the bases of my hair follicles
 which provide shelter and shade
these critters are peculiar to
   the ecology of the human face
     which i take around the city
     open close   it is my means
    of feeding   i rely on
  changing its shape
in response to others faces and postures
  to reduce my risk and increase my safety
   and my likelihood of being
    included in the groups collective
      life i smile a lot and hope it
     dont look fake
children in a pool of light a pool of dust the way
images deceive the way time shunts and stalls a test
of what gathers and corrupts what will not stay
as words unspeak as children are lost to light and dust
and we would watch the starry hours 
and call the moon to hear our vows 
and we would cull the sweetest flowers 
and twine fresh chaplets for our brows 
 yes of forsythia against the limitless ivy a nude posed in a garden
against the silver maple pinwheeling its children into a gown around her
stricken seen satellite at the edge of a party
being fifteen with the black bulbs someones planted
in the mothers lamps to give glowinthedark
ambiance to hideous kisses and the ruffles
are all wrong on the savedfor shirt and the curtains
suave in the murk seem to laugh the liquidy
fin of feeling is destinationless twisting
like paper wrapped round a pinkie
in blind date anticipation toy for
the psyche phrase to swim through the mind
like an offense at  am
halfhelix as if waiting for oh god dont
say it a soul mate what sheathes the stealth
bomber has something of its skin pastiche of pluck
and terror nerve faltering halfway opposite
of starlight stagnant brook that drowned ophelia jpeg
from a former colleague on holiday landed in spam
looking older and captioned well here i am
chime of the cliffhanging falcons screeching talons against a rabbit
wheezing soldier in a field gunpowder tainting the cake in his pocket
jet fuel over the pacific waking to a hula in a zephyr
the bride deplaning onto an island chain bowing to leis of plumeria
the mallow of nurses shoes their news the black sedan
of a telephone spreading it like a virus and after the scent of a cedar closet
white gloves of a mare in heat pawing clover the sail of a spitfire
cresting a hill in san francisco angelic against sunset
rosin on the cellos catgut a honeycombed queen calling home
her lovers a basquiat above the head of an ascetic chaos over order
magenta in the thorns shy to the shears making the blue jays bluer
a someone on the beds chenille edge composing an oratorio of medicines
the bartender in his ice pick scars twisting zest over his creation wheel
and butane of his zippo kissing as the citrus at last expresses
source poetry may 
i thought thus of the flowers the moon 
this fairy isle for you and me 
and then i thought how very soon 
how very tired we should be
                  matrimonial creed
he must be rich whom i could love 
his fortune clear must be 
whether in land or in the funds 
tis all the same to me 
he must be old whom i could love 
then hell not plague me long 
in sooth twill he a pleasant sight
to see him borne along 
to where the croaking ravens lurk 
and where the earth worms dwell 
a widows hood will suit my face
and black becomes me well 
and he must make a settlement 
ill have no man without 
and when he writes his testament 
he must not leave me out 
oh such a man as this would suit 
each wish i here express 
if he should say  will you have me 
ill very soon say  yes 
                       holed up behind the whitewashed wooden slats
slung like ribs above the greedbegotten candy plaster
papered noworlaters holed up and far
from witches in the woods evergreen fringe
horse chestnut brews parents crow commotion or
robin squabble haranguing the fat
wide open always out there i read for hours
on the red shag rug hearing market cry
and grave slope catching the men through ages
of flint and full haggle in my  by  chamber
heart bent on blue beard the dead wives
skeletons cantilevered to a door hook later
hunkering down with amputee hangers
catalogs the bottle stash and jug wines
jim beams too hiding with air no air
plus a stolen joy of sex circa 
its pell mell positions and crouching
women with the pov going scrap and rattle
some theater of being a little less bright
thought i saw one night the million paired eyes
swinging upward the hand me down generations
spelunking in holes fine lineaments braved
by way of cream curd and lust and dictatorial dna
felt through overhead squib and carpet warp
some full squat before the slate rock hearths
more buried in strata of granites igneous
limestone ash the minds eye leveled
to one rectangle of light around the animal
who wants to know that it knows and say so
lumbering down the long path vanishing
              to begin with life or stars
                                                              the spring as source or

                        said about the birds
                        as distance is required for attraction
                         force keeps its distinctions
                        in a tall hull
                        called law
                        clever in the style of depth in a painting
                        sumptuous for use and briefly this
                        of fancy pity and devising
                        wherefore as it is at the right door
                        make it language or rejoice
                        this is how you touch me in my other ghosts
                         short of the occasion
                        just a frequent mist of atoms
                        all touching in the arms
                        like an error in the wish
the lights seltzer bubbles
i said my lord i thought
my god o moonstruck o gladracket barring
gravity our knees could be forevering each other
barring leather love is a world im praying
all my mothers joy back toward
elizabeth was my name im writing this on all the trees like a wish
im kissing every hem in sight
were all hysterical  going nowhere together
cmon rapture lets go bedazzling
nothing gets futured without its own spitshine
 im already not not not not not not miraculous
beautiful it is not and if im being honest
glitz girls in the spackle teen climbed
the boughed over stair stole lace to begin again
in darkness a fingering salt print
delighted the line to lined
pink was dollsized weighted out was flatreaped sigh
and dollar bin plaid fridays we stayed in
till in coughed through with dry heat men
grew approximate in their longing for something to mine
sippy cup of burn acrylic camel and melting kohl
was a hiding past boyish we shone with miraculous
droll dont try to kiss me she was always saying older
than a watch the girl who pays starch to hush
meat gargantuan between grown and still us
i leave her orange street my wanting ode
my partner and i spend most of our time
on earth feeding one another citrus fruits
and enough strength to go on every morning
i pack them half a grapefruit and some sugar
and they tell me its just sweet enough
dear sip dear shotgun dear pound
i wont get lucky get found
but kegs run out the hour brims
the party flips its switches down
his hips to mine his arms around
a song ends and dark begins
dear sip dear shotgun dear pound
the party flips its switches down
i remind her of a cookie in a dream she had of heaven or
hellbut which was it everything that happens in the
world has someone to say its their fault repress it as
they may the cutout in the cocktail bar wants to go
home with someone for once the snakeskin hangs on
the gate like its a street corner that each uttered baby
renews knowing can be a means to forgetting also
we stand there as if the floor or wall is our companion
our fortress in trouble mates a bit longer keeping sex at
bay not everyone looks where theyre going or cares
where others are theyre the rugged ones though fleet
as moths when crossing a highway sometimes despite
our own egos we admire this as if wise that the pattern
of the one ahead wont ultimately save or brave us
dont rush the star we wake to mightnt always be
there so we wander outside as if air were itself a prayer
or someones is that for me addressing an ivy or a wet
plank suddenly hungry tell me what happened to peter
and wendy and the loser with the hook for a hand was
it all alright in the end they say time is nothing but it
takes the saying to make it so to be the one is to
vanquish sinatra but also life not that life is patriarchy
repress the possibility for the sake of staying young as
around the bend a boat may contain the set of problems
that will have always been around attitudes to dancing
housework contraception ever musics themes a wall
flower may remind themselves of wallpaper peeling to
reveal a peasant who goes to sleep at dusk behind their
tux but does that haunt you more than the possibility
of possessing truth is that what your glances are about
i am so small walking on the beach
at night under the widening sky
the wet sand quickens beneath my feet
and the waves thunder against the shore
i am moving away from the boardwalk
with its colorful streamers of people
and the hotels with their blinking lights
the wind sighs for hundreds of miles
i am disappearing so far into the dark
i have vanished from sight
i am a tiny seashell
that has secretly drifted ashore
and carries the sound of the ocean
surging through its body
i am so small now no one can see me
how can i be filled with such a vast love
i take her in my hands
i open her gently
i part her pages
i stare at her words
i want her letters in my mouth
i run my hand down her spine
i love reading her
i love making love to her
i let her fall asleep in my lap
i pledge to sit upright in my coffin
as soon as the morgueice melts and turn
a cheek grayer than this dusk kiss it
even if it doesnt remind you of yesterday
but let your tact disregard the breath
of a corpse mingled with the musk
you emptied on my breast the belched outrage
from a belly domed in gas is simply
my way of saying honey im home
the carrion fly counting the fibers
in my nose is no heavenly harbinger
discount it as youd discount a bird
on a clich and fear nothing for theres nothing
left to fear darling im in no hurry
take your time in bringing me a rose
of that pinot we once praised to the sky
and let my tongue gad about in a warm
crimson bay i swear to lie back forever
when the stylus roundly vexes a scratch
he was first a snake and was in love with hera shesnake and then he molted and after he molted he was a turtle and he met another sheturtle and fell in love with her when he deshelled after years he became a fourlegged animal black spots sprouting over his fur and he fell for a leopard he moved this way through the jungles the savannas the deserts the skies through the oceans the air the land and beneath it changing and changing and meeting and falling in love with new shespecies
the lovers he left behind did not change they were who they were the same
they were individualistic so to speak but now they were also heartbroken and full of hate for himthe one who had left in the middle of sometimes passionate lovemaking
they had no idea how it was to live so many lives in one life like him
to take no breaks with rebirths from being mosquito to man
sometimes evolution and progress is so fast blessings and curses are all mixed up and one
forgive me
i say to the wall
my life is paper
my jaws rust
wanderer singing
the sky is my home
i throw roses into it
to color it red
stop these roads
grow from me
my journey must end
because my destinations
have ended
kneeling like a priest
seeing the spherical eyes
of flies my wish
emptiness and sudden light
resurrection i am dead
from itthe attempt to live
again
it sings as me when i sleep
the world dressed in yellow
never have songs
meant for me what they do
when you sing
i leave you haloes and clothes
i leave you violently
like the wail of an exile
forget me my truth
my masterpiece is
my nonexistence
sunrise unbreakable dawn
i open your book
it has no pages
what will i take instead you ask solenoid ouroboros and african paayal words we learnt from each other sputters of laughter over the misspelling of rcipiendaire in my hundredandtwentypaged dissertation you went on to supervise a first date with patrice chreaus intimacy that left us bereft of voice but not touch the spring lost in paris and retrieved in rome neonate but blithe and loud den bosch and its soundless mornings where even birds meditate dublin yes despite the disasters with missing kathak ankle bells and katana those shy cities that blush at dusk when the suns gaze fills with sudden desire others undressed by moonlight the unsubsidized incomplete report science and the art of rolling balls and other machines all the lines of poetry you thought and refused to write the crackle and splutter of toast burning before breakfast a tuneless humming muffled by shower curtains matinal halfhour radioswitch battles between rfi and bbc world sighting the smile on a natal cleft as you reach up for the tin of dark chocolate haroun and the sea of stories and invisible cities more mine than yours yes i can play dirty on this canal saintmartinbut only the curve between the caf le valmy and pont de la grangeauxbelles koodiyattam as a birthday surprise when the gods left their paddy fields and invaded paris complete with cobalt and emerald cheeks human woes and joys the first encounter with pina bauschs caf mller every single one with her rite of spring my fear of dying alone in a strange city at night copper and caramel the two shades your gaze seems to traverse between dusk and daybreak other constellations pisces and lynx and phoenix the ancient fleece jacket each would wear when the other was not around all of terry pratchetts discworld books we owned together the word together as well the fact you shared aloud in surprise at tea a giraffes heart weighs an incredible  pounds today tomorrow a spring tide of tomorrows  
our granaries flowed with deposits of sweetest kernels
like squirrels we were the saviors of a future
in winters clamp we siphoned liqueurs using deepstemmed waterlilies
returning to redeem we found brittle rocksugar
clouded air traps
ice spikes
fossil prints
whenever i open my mouth crater
blisters i take for moonwalking shoes
sentries out the front
slips at the backdoor
the bloat floats
fatwrapped
fleafeeling
two people have a third person between them
one of them is always responsible for her disappearance
parched beehives in their stomachs they look everywhere
lightning and smoke form duration in the i ching clouds
she wont say shoo
we must be
the inviolate
petals always
queering to
ward the sun
must be water
on the lips of
flaming cities
quenching
the husbands
insatiable these
days the abdomen
blossoms but
we must be
boneless edible
fish we must
beg for bouquets
for absent sons
this is how we
know devotion
listening to lovers
sleep breathing
like monster trucks
wanting to soothe
them when the dream
is done we march
the sinking avenues
finger the curls
at the babys neck
hanging from
the brink at
office hour
gulping xanax
in their white
oblong shells
cities can sleep
but we can never
vigilant animals
on our hands and
knees asking for
each temple is an offering made to the gods
by giving them a home
did you ever feel this astonished
by the blood drawn from
your arms when you took a step forward
and the air scraped you
maybe you think peace think it
as a floral carpet a persistent scent
that is supposed to be
a memory you treasure only
it was put there by someone else
when the sun hits
it feels like something
someone cooks soup
you love a person you envy
and the emotions wash
into a teacup
and you drink them
and your teeth are stormstained
if there were a wave
blueblack flooding lives out
spinning each person
and the next
and their needs
together as if they were fabrics
in a laundry machine
could i ever trust it if i touch
and you forget
you have borders against nature
were floating somewhere
in a primordial pool
and ive got you and ive got you
an inward realization can only be achieved
by draining out your wealth and strength so he went on
another building rampage
a world conquer campaign as my brother used to say
drew a straight line across a map
and let the priest and the architect connect
the fact that often it was a queen
on whose insistence these stone gardens were built
if i had known      all those     days
to listen deep   into myself      so that you
would begin      to hear      me      id sooner
soak      the decibels      of      your cells
into  the exhale  of my      embrace
            a scorning within       is within
                coming back      to scorn
a rose quartz promise      lifted into
the world   is the world      coming back
                          to surrender      its love
even after      i took my health
into a vineyard      of hawks
i could not break myself from caring
but only     to seek you      find you
            whisper into your palm
you are not lost      you wont be lost
whats godhead
now standing upright
fecundity no less
i tell you more about
phases of the moon you see
an auspicious moment ive
come to believe in with
shiva or some other deity
what greece from antiquity
bestowed upon us with an
outsider named sikander
alexander the great going
to the indus valley but not
ancient rome i presume to
know less about then its
parvati consort of shiva
being on the diurnal stage
as i dwell on enlightenment
fires burning and smoke
rising from the ground
sandalwood the ghee of life
with avatars coming closer
and i will recite mantras
when shiva looks back at me
from the corner of his eye
as i pretend i am in some
other place like rishikesh
close to the ganges but
here by the rideau river
this north with celestial fires
making promises to myself
from long ago
then the smaller more regular ones weekend washing the family of filthy plates and pans and casseroles somersaulting well past burnished wooden spigots to be the first to greet me when arriving at your ancient garret in angers by the last tgv just grazing past midnight and the lone last tramwith that recurrent halfannoyed halfamused thought would you first run out of copper and steel and stone space in your cavernous sink or the resolve never to soap and scrub and rinse dryings all right  
happier lowmaintenance rites as well molten dark hot chocolate brunches to celebrate impending surgery yes celebrate the verb wed adopted as shaggy wetnosed mongrel just right for consolation the nights in hospital where i kneweach timeyou woke to place quiet fingers and parse the storm warnings within my breath then the weeks of bingerelishing wong karwai filmsfrom ashes of time to  we as we would not live to see my blueberry nights and norah jonesfor sustenance through rebirth and recovery till i rose irrevocably in love with patrice chreau after son  frre  and  it  is  true  seldom  returned  
all these and a few more diffident others went
missing in that one endless afternoon of our
remaindering slipped awayunnoticed
amidst the naming the labeling the
allotting the packing they could
have fled through the fissures
in the kitchen wall or rolled
down cracks in the floor
boardsand some i
reckon even threw
themselves out
of windows
wed left
open
            throb
you do not know me if you graze
my saber  my light
but not the wound i guard         accuses another
of everything but love         demands
cameras safety whistles glue
to hold herself together
against the brutal gaze      we only need
these awkward straps heatslick dildos
kutchi mirrors concentric abstract
aurae of this crescent moon
sweeping our bodies w cool white
reflected  deflected light
because of what weve lost or left
because the language is disaster
because our species has forgotten
acute angles
triple dream projected
inner outer secret
on empty aching
temple walls        afterward
the residue      what isnt conscious
throngs toward the surface
 joyandsorrow fishes
crashing into air

he stood at the back of his old church wanting to join in with the congregation
everyone followed the priest
i confess to almighty god and to you my brothers and sisters that
i have sinned through my own fault in my thoughts and in my words
he looked for her the back of many blackhaired heads made
his stomach upset heads all bent
he glimpsed her thick plait curled on her shoulder by
the end of the penitential act moving he saw her
always in a sari always with her mother
their son sat up on the altar his shoes shinier
than all the other boys his mother would have shone
them with kiwi shoe polish and an old brush the sound
would wake him she must be watching him to keep
his face still her son on the altar at morning mass
their daughter was handinhand with mother and
grandmother her two plaits shone with oil after
the shoes her mother would have woken and washed
her for mass she would tell the small girl stop crying
while tightly plaiting her thickoiled hair

what is a poem if it cannot try
to call you a ing  or die
whispering in your arms this lie
when kabira met keats he said
our poems make canopies overhead
always
or beloved if i told you
we are words
and the spaces between us
make poetry
would you not say
piya why the fuss
we knew it was thus
will it ask
 if you want definitions here is one a lover is one who waits
beauty is brief and violent
like the white thunderbolt
of nilgiri slow and sudden
braided like her hair
one morning was a cluster
of grapes hung beside each
ear maybe it comes from where
hunger the voices of children
come breaking their way
to my heart the stones
my feet which are light
and heavy from walking
that path full and swift
the river flows eroding
the banks with its sinuous
desire gentle and unkind
the days the years boulders
tossed by a giant down the hill
we must climb to the sudden
sinuous blue
the next part the part where definitions are unwoven and the threads laid bare can be left to barthes roland who said everything about it that needs to be said and for what cannot be and there are still some of those things there are films whichno matter what the structuralists sayare not to be read
there was a girl who sat every evening at a particular table hoping it was close enough to where the boys sat to make it appear a natural veering off when if he came to sit at it opposite her but not close enough to make her seem desperate
not always was her waiting played out as gestures of solitude other people gave her company there was nothing in her face that could be read as signs of biding this did not mean that she knew her time was up this did not mean that she ceased to wonder and hope and despair and curse
this is where barthes got the story of the mandarin wrong the one who pined for the courtesan who had said that after the th night of waiting she would be his what barthes did was to report the mandarins departure on the penultimate night he didnt say how on the night the mandarin left the courtesan had made up her mind to tell him hed waited enough he could come in and

is it true that troy lived life without a
written form before the greeks invaded
with their horse or did i learn that from a poem
either way is that not how affection

the fingers then dropped into the subway vestibule

little ellie sits alone 
  mid the beeches of a meadow   
    by a streamside on the grass  
and the trees are showering down 
  doubles of their leaves in shadow         
    on her shining hair and face   
she has thrown her bonnet by 
  and her feet she has been dipping 
    in the shallow waters flow 
now she holds them nakedly         
  in her hands all sleek and dripping   
    while she rocketh to and fro   
little ellie sits alone   
  and the smile she softly uses  
    fills the silence like a speech         
while she thinks what shall be done   
  and the sweetest pleasure chooses 
    for her future within reach 
little ellie in her smile  
  choosesi will have a lover          
    riding on a steed of steeds 
he shall love me without guile  
  and to him i will discover  
    the swans nest among the reeds   
and the steed shall be redroan           
  and the lover shall be noble  
    with an eye that takes the breath 
and the lute he plays upon 
  shall strike ladies into trouble 
    as his sword strikes men to death         
and the steed it shall be shod  
  all in silver housed in azure   
    and the mane shall swim the wind  
and the hoofs along the sod   
  shall flash onward and keep measure         
    till the shepherds look behind 
but my lover will not prize  
  all the glory that he rides in   
    when he gazes in my face 
he will say o love thine eyes         
  build the shrine my soul abides in  
    and i kneel here for thy grace   
then ay then he shall kneel low 
  with the redroan steed anear him 
    which shall seem to understand         
till i answer rise and go  
  for the world must love and fear him 
    whom i gift with heart and hand  
then he will arise so pale  
  i shall feel my own lips tremble          
    with a yes i must not say   
nathless maidenbrave farewell  
  i will utter and dissemble   
    light tomorrow with today  
then hell ride among the hills         
  to the wide world past the river 
    there to put away all wrong 
to make straight distorted wills   
  and to empty the broad quiver  
    which the wicked bear along         
three times shall a young footpage   
  swim the stream and climb the mountain  
    and kneel down beside my feet  
lo my master sends this gage  
  lady for thy pitys counting         
    what wilt thou exchange for it   
and the first time i will send  
  a white rosebud for a guerdon 
    and the second time a glove   
but the third timei may bend         
  from my pride and answerpardon   
    if he comes to take my love   
then the young footpage will run 
  then my lover will ride faster   
    till he kneeleth at my knee         
i am a dukes eldest son 
  thousand serfs do call me master 
    but o love i love but thee  
seven maidens neath the midnight   
  stand near the riversea   
whose water sweepeth white around   
  the shadow of the tree  
the moon and earth are face to face           
  and earth is slumbering deep  
the wavevoice seems the voice of dreams  
  that wander through her sleep 
                the river floweth on  
what bring they neath the midnight           
  beside the riversea 
they bring the human heart wherein  
  no nightly calm can be 
that droppeth never with the wind  
  nor drieth with the dew         
o calm it god thy calm is broad  
  to cover spirits too   
                the river floweth on  
the maidens lean them over 
  the waters side by side           
and shun each others deepening eyes  
  and gaze adown the tide 
for each within a little boat 
  a little lamp hath put  
and heaped for freight some lilys weight         
  or scarlet rose half shut  
                the river floweth on  
of a shell of cocoa carven   
  each little boat is made   
each carries a lamp and carries a flower           
  and carries a hope unsaid  
and when the boat hath carried the lamp   
  unquenched till out of sight 
the maidens are sure that love will endure 
  but love will fail with light         
                the river floweth on  
why all the stars are ready  
  to symbolize the soul   
the stars untroubled by the wind   
  unwearied as they roll          
and yet the soul by instinct sad 
  reverts to symbols low 
to that small flame whose very name   
  breathed oer it shakes it so   
                the river floweth on          
six boats are on the river   
  seven maidens on the shore 
while still above them steadfastly  
  the stars shine evermore   
go little boats go soft and safe         
  and guard the symbol spark 
the boats aright go safe and bright 
  across the waters dark  
                the river floweth on  
the maiden luti watcheth           
  where onwardly they float  
that look in her dilating eyes   
  might seem to drive her boat  
her eyes still mark the constant fire 
  and kindling unawares         
that hopeful while she lets a smile 
  creep silent through her prayers 
                the river floweth on  
the smilewhere hath it wandered  
  she riseth from her knee           
she holds her dark wet locks away   
  there is no light to see   
she cries a quick and bitter cry   
  nuleeni launch me thine  
we must have light abroad tonight         
  for all the wreck of mine 
                the river floweth on  
i do remember watching 
  beside this riverbed   
when on my childish knee was laid           
  my dying fathers head  
i turned mine own to keep the tears   
  from falling on his face  
what doth it prove when death and love 
  choose out the selfsame place           
                the river floweth on  
they say the dead are joyful 
  the deathchange here receiving  
who sayall me who dare to say 
  where joy comes to the living         
thy boat nuleeni look not sad   
  light up the waters rather 
i weep no faithless lover where  
  i wept a loving father 
                the river floweth on          
my heart foretold his falsehood 
  ere my little boat grew dim   
and though i closed mine eyes to dream 
  that one last dream of him 
they shall not now be wet to see         
  the shining vision go   
from earths cold love i look above 
  to the holy house of snow 
                the river floweth on  
come thouthou never knewest           
  a grief that thou shouldst fear one   
thou wearest still the happy look   
  that shines beneath a dear one   
thy hummingbird is in the sun  
  thy cuckoo in the grove         
and all the three broad worlds for thee  
  are full of wandering love   
                the river floweth on  
why maiden dost thou loiter  
  what secret wouldst thou cover           
that peepul cannot hide thy boat   
  and i can guess thy lover  
i heard thee sob his name in sleep   
  it was a name i knew   
come little maid be not afraid           
  but let us prove him true 
                the river floweth on  
the little maiden cometh  
  she cometh shy and slow 
i ween she seeth through her lids          
  they drop adown so low  
her tresses meet her small bare feet 
  she stands and speaketh naught   
yet blusheth red as if she said 
  the name she only thought          
                the river floweth on  
she knelt beside the water   
  she lighted up the flame   
and oer her youthful foreheads calm  
  the fitful radiance came           
go little boat go soft and safe   
  and guard the symbol spark   
soft safe doth float the little boat 
  across the waters dark  
                the river floweth on          
glad tears her eyes have blinded   
  the light they cannot reach   
she turneth with that sudden smile  
  she learnt before her speech 
i do not hear his voice the tears         
  have dimmed my light away  
but the symbol light will last tonight  
  the love will last for aye   
                the river floweth on  
then luti spake behind her          
  outspake she bitterly   
by the symbol light that lasts tonight 
  wilt vow a vow to me   
nuleeni gazeth up her face  
  soft answer maketh she          
by loves that last when lights are past 
  i vow that vow to thee 
                the river floweth on  
an earthly look had luti   
  though her voice was deep as prayer           
the rice is gathered from the plains  
  to cast upon thine hair 
but when he comes his marriageband   
  around thy neck to throw   
thy bridesmile raise to meet his gaze           
and whisperthere is one betrays  
  when luti suffers woe  
                the river floweth on  
and when in seasons after   
  thy little brightfaced son         
shall kneel against thy knee and ask   
  what deeds his sire hath done 
press deeper down thy mothersmile  
  his glossy curls among 
view deep his pretty childish eyes         
and whisperthere is none denies  
  when luti speaks of wrong 
                the river floweth on  
nuleeni looked in wonder   
  yet softly answered she           
by loves that last when lights are past 
  i vowed that vow to thee   
but why glads it thee that a brideday be 
  by a word of woe defiled   
that a word of wrong take the cradlesong         
  from the ear of a sinless child 
  why luti said and her laugh was dread 
  and her eyes dilated wild 
that the fair new love may her bridegroom prove  
  and the father shame the child          
                the river floweth on  
 the old idea of romance the country boy goes to the city marries his employers daughter enslaves some hundreds of his fellow humans gets rich and leaves a public library to his home town   
  the new idea of romance to undo some of the mischief done by the old idea of romance    
thy face is far from this our war  
  our call and countercry   
i shall not find thee quick and kind  
  nor know thee till i die   
enough for me in dreams to see           
  and touch thy garments hem   
thy feet have trod so near to god   
  i may not follow them   
through wantonness if men profess   
  they weary of thy parts         
een let them die at blasphemy   
  and perish with their arts 
but we that love but we that prove 
  thine excellence august 
while we adore discover more         
  thee perfect wise and just  
since spoken word mans spirit stirred 
  beyond his bellyneed   
what is is thine of fair design  
  in thought and craft and deed         
each stroke aright of toil and fight  
  that was and that shall be 
and hope too high wherefore we die 
  has birth and worth in thee   
who holds by thee hath heaven in fee           
  to gild his dross thereby  
and knowledge sure that he endure   
  a child until he die 
for to make plain that mans disdain   
  is but new beautys birth          
for to possess in singleness  
  the joy of all the earth   
as thou didst teach all lovers speech  
  and life all mystery 
so shalt thou rule by every school          
  till life and longing die  
who wast or yet the lights were set   
  a whisper in the void   
who shalt be sung through planets young   
  when this is clean destroyed          
beyond the bounds our staring rounds  
  across the pressing dark   
the children wise of outer skies 
  look hitherward and mark 
a light that shifts a glare that drifts         
  rekindling thus and thus   
not all forlorn for thou hast borne   
  strange tales to them of us   
time hath no tide but must abide 
  the servant of thy will         
tide hath no time for to thy rhyme 
  the ranging stars stand still 
regent of spheres that lock our fears  
  our hopes invisible  
oh t was certes at thy decrees          
  we fashioned heaven and hell  
pure wisdom hath no certain path 
  that lacks thy morningeyne   
and captains bold by thee controlled   
  most like to gods design           
thou art the voice to kingly boys   
  to lift them through the fight   
and comfortress of unsuccess 
  to give the dead goodnight   
a veil to draw twixt god his law           
  and mans infirmity  
a shadow kind to dumb and blind  
  the shambles where we die  
a rule to trick th arithmetic  
  too base of leaguing odds         
the spur of trust the curb of lust   
  thou handmaid of the gods  
o charity all patiently   
  abiding wrack and scaith   
o faith that meets ten thousand cheats           
  yet drops no jot of faith  
devil and brute thou dost transmute 
  to higher lordlier show   
who art in sooth that lovely truth  
  the careless angels know           
thy face is far from this our war  
  our call and countercry   
i may not find thee quick and kind 
  nor know thee till i die   
yet may i look with heart unshook           
  on blow brought home or missed   
yet may i hear with equal ear 
  the clarions down the list 
yet set my lance above mischance 
  and ride the barriere           
oh hit or miss how little t is  
  my lady is not there
thou flowest still o river 
  thou flowest neath the moon 
thy lily hath not changed a leaf   
  thy charmd lute a tune         
he mixed his voice with thineand his 
  was all i heard around  
but now beside his chosen bride   
  i hear the rivers sound  
                the river floweth on          
i gaze upon her beauty 
  through the tresses that enwreathe it  
the light above thy wave is hers  
  my rest alone beneath it  
o give me back the dying look           
  my father gave thy water   
give back and let a little love 
  oerwatch his weary daughter 
                the river floweth on  
give back she hath departed         
  the word is wandering with her   
and the stricken maidens hear afar  
  the step and cry together  
frail symbols none are frail enow  
  for mortal joys to borrow          
while bright doth float nuleenis boat   
  she weepeth dark with sorrow 
                the river floweth on  
he will kiss me on the mouth 
  then and lead me as a lover           
    through the crowds that praise his deeds   
and when soultied by one troth   
  unto him i will discover 
    that swans nest among the reeds 
little ellie with her smile          
  not yet ended rose up gaily  
    tied the bonnet donned the shoe  
and went homeward round a mile 
  just to see as she did daily 
    what more eggs were with the two          
pushing through the elmtree copse 
  winding up the stream lighthearted   
    where the osier pathway leads  
past the boughs she stoopsand stops  
  lo the wild swan had deserted           
    and a rat had knawed the reeds 
ellie went home sad and slow 
  if she found the lover ever   
    with his redroan steed of steeds 
sooth i know not but i know          
  she could never show himnever   
    that swans nest among the reeds  
fain  would i change that note  
to which fond love hath charmd me  
long long ago to sing by rote   
fancying that that harmd me 
yet when this thought doth come         
love is the perfect sum   
    of all delight 
i have no other choice  
either for pen or voice 
    to sing or write           
o love they wrong thee much  
that say thy sweet is bitter 
when thy rich fruit is such   
as nothing can be sweeter 
fair house of joy and bliss          
where truest pleasure is  
    i do adore thee 
i know thee what thou art 
i serve thee with my heart   
    and fall before thee
i love to steal awhile away   
  from every cumbering care  
and spend the hours of setting day  
  in humble grateful prayer 
i love in solitude to shed          
  the penitential tear 
and all his promises to plead   
  when none but god can hear 
i love to think on mercies past 
  and future good implore         
and all my cares and sorrows cast   
  on him whom i adore  
i love by faith to take a view 
  of brighter scenes in heaven  
the prospect doth my strength renew           
  while here by tempests driven 
thus when lifes toilsome day is oer   
  may its departing ray 
be calm as this impressive hour 
  and lead to endless day
and so one day as ever of old  
  hands out they hurried knee to knee         
on fire to cling and kiss and hold  
  and in the others eyes to see  
  each his own tiny face  
  and in that long embrace 
  feel lip and breast grow warm         
  to breast and lip and arm  
so knee to knee they sped again 
  and laugh to laugh they ran im told  
across the streets of hell   
  and then         
  they suddenly felt the wind blow cold  
  and knew so closely pressed  
  chill air on lip and breast   
  and with a sick surprise  
  the emptiness of eyes
the hunchd camels of the night   
trouble the bright    
and silver waters of the moon    
the maiden of the morn will soon  
through heaven stray and sing            
star gathering    
now while the dark about our loves is strewn    
light of my dark blood of my heart o come  
and night will catch her breath up and be dumb    
leave thy father leave thy mother    
and thy brother   
leave the black tents of thy tribe apart  
am i not thy father and thy brother    
and thy mother    
and thouwhat needest with thy tribes black tents   
who hast the red pavilion of my heart
    foul evil of the joys he may not share  
there is no stain in love the only sin   
    is his who scorns the garb of love to wear 
sweet home of passion nest of mated hearts  
    quick throbbing each to each in wild desire           
till swift resistless through each pulse and vein   
    leaps quivering forth loves own magnetic fire   
o wretched empty lives that never knew  
    the thrill of loves ecstatic fierce embrace 
when lips to lips tight pressed heart beats to heart          
    with hot sharp breaths and lovefired limbs enlace   
thy sweet will love be done from that blest couch  
    fond lovers may not rise unsatisfied 
denied the crowning act of perfect bliss 
    when being into being seems to glide         
rest loving hearts in blissful lassitude  
    still tightly clasped in soft encircling arms   
sleep sweetly sleep to wake and taste again   
    the maddening richness of each others charms 
loves hour is brief but crowned with wealth beyond          
    the brightest splendors of the loveless years 
the thrones of monarchs and the seats of gods   
    shrink all to naught in loves bright smiles or tears  
best home of love to many an amorous fray   
    we vow thy snowy sheets to dedicate          
that bards to come in oftrepeated strains 
    thy perfect hours may long commemorate
the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the windowpanes         
the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the windowpanes   
licked its tongue into the corners of the evening 
lingered upon the pools that stand in drains   
let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys   
slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap          
and seeing that it was a soft october night 
curled once about the house and fell asleep   
 what meaneth this when i lie alone   
i toss i turn i sigh i groan 
my bed me seems as hard as stone   
        what means this   
i sigh i plain continually          
the clothes that on my bed do lie  
always me think they lie awry   
        what means this   
in slumbers oft for fear i quake   
for heat and cold i burn and shake         
for lack of sleep my head doth ake 
        what means this   
a mornings then when i do rise  
i turn unto my wonted guise  
all day after muse and devise           
        what means this   
and if perchance by me there pass  
she unto whom i sue for grace  
the cold blood forsaketh my face   
        what means this           
but if i sit near her by  
with loud voice my heart doth cry  
and yet my mouth is dumb and dry   
        what means this   
to ask for help no heart i have         
my tongue doth fail what i should crave  
yet inwardly i rage and rave 
        what means this   
thus have i passed many a year  
and many a day though nought appear          
but most of that that most i fear  
        what means this
and indeed there will be time 
for the yellow smoke that slides along the street 
rubbing its back upon the window panes           
there will be time there will be time 
to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet 
there will be time to murder and create  
and time for all the works and days of hands 
that lift and drop a question on your plate         
time for you and time for me 
and time yet for a hundred indecisions   
and for a hundred visions and revisions  
before the taking of a toast and tea  
in the room the women come and go           
talking of michelangelo   
and indeed there will be time 
to wonder do i dare and do i dare 
time to turn back and descend the stair  
with a bald spot in the middle of my hair           
they will say how his hair is growing thin   
my morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin  
my necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin   
they will say but how his arms and legs are thin   
do i dare           
disturb the universe   
in a minute there is time  
for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse 
for i have known them all already known them all 
have known the evenings mornings afternoons          
i have measured out my life with coffee spoons 
i know the voices dying with a dying fall 
beneath the music from a farther room 
  so how should i presume 
and i have known the eyes already known them all         
the eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase   
and when i am formulated sprawling on a pin   
when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall  
then how should i begin 
to spit out all the buttends of my days and ways         
  and how should i presume   
and i have known the arms already known them all 
arms that are braceleted and white and bare  
but in the lamplight downed with light brown hair 
is it perfume from a dress         
that makes me so digress  
arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl   
  and should i then presume  
  and how should i begin
     
    
    
    
    
    
     
shall i say i have gone at dusk through narrow streets          
and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes 
of lonely men in shirtsleeves leaning out of windows 
i should have been a pair of ragged claws 
scuttling across the floors of silent seas
     
    
    
    
    
    
     
and the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully         
smoothed by long fingers  
asleep  tired  or it malingers   
stretched on the floor here beside you and me 
should i after tea and cakes and ices   
have the strength to force the moment to its crisis          
but though i have wept and fasted wept and prayed   
though i have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter   
i am no prophetand heres no great matter  
i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker 
and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker         
and in short i was afraid   
and would it have been worth it after all  
after the cups the marmalade the tea   
among the porcelain among some talk of you and me   
would it have been worth while          
to have bitten off the matter with a smile  
to have squeezed the universe into a ball 
to roll it toward some overwhelming question   
to say i am lazarus come from the dead   
come back to tell you all i shall tell you all          
if one settling a pillow by her head 
  should say that is not what i meant at all 
  that is not it at all 
and would it have been worth it after all  
would it have been worth while          
after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets 
after the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor   
and this and so much more  
it is impossible to say just what i mean 
but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen          
would it have been worth while   
if one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl 
and turning toward the window should say   
  that is not it at all  
  that is not what i meant at all
     
    
    
    
    
    
     
        
no i am not prince hamlet nor was meant to be   
am an attendant lord one that will do 
to swell a progress start a scene or two   
advise the prince no doubt an easy tool   
deferential glad to be of use          
politic cautious and meticulous  
full of high sentence but a bit obtuse  
at times indeed almost ridiculous   
almost at times the fool   
i grow old  i grow old           
i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled 
shall i part my hair behind do i dare to eat a peach   
i shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach  
i have heard the mermaids singing each to each   
i do not think that they will sing to me         
i have seen them riding seaward on the waves 
combing the white hair of the waves blown back  
when the wind blows the water white and black  
we have lingered in the chambers of the sea  
by seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown           
till human voices wake us and we drown
love bade me welcome yet my soul drew back  
      guilty of dust and sin  
but quickeyed love observing me grow slack  
      from my first entrance in  
drew nearer to me sweetly questioning          
      if i lackd anything    
a guest i answerd worthy to be here   
     love said you shall be he   
i the unkind ungrateful ah my dear   
      i cannot look on thee   
love took my hand and smiling did reply   
      who made the eyes but i  
truth lord but i have marrd them let my shame  
      go where it doth deserve  
and know you not says love who bore the blame    
      my dear then i will serve  
you must sit down says love and taste my meat   
      so i did sit and eat    
my spectre around me night and day  
like a wild beast guards my way 
my emanation far within 
weeps incessantly for my sin 
a fathomless and boundless deep           
there we wander there we weep  
on the hungry craving wind 
my spectre follows thee behind  
he scents thy footsteps in the snow   
wheresoever thou dost go         
thro the wintry hail and rain  
when wilt thou return again  
dost thou not in pride and scorn   
fill with tempests all my morn  
and with jealousies and fears        
fill my pleasant nights with tears 
seven of my sweet loves thy knife  
has bereavd of their life   
their marble tombs i built with tears 
and with cold and shuddering fears        
seven more loves weep night and day   
round the tombs where my loves lay 
and seven more loves attend each night 
around my couch with torches bright   
and seven more loves in my bed         
crown with wine my mournful head   
pitying and forgiving all  
thy transgressions great and small 
when wilt thou return and view  
my loves and them to life renew          
when wilt thou return and live  
when wilt thou pity as i forgive  
oer my sins thou sit and moan 
hast thou no sins of thy own 
oer my sins thou sit and weep         
and lull thy own sins fast asleep  
what transgressions i commit 
are for thy transgressions fit  
they thy harlots thou their slave 
and my bed becomes their grave         
never never i return   
still for victory i burn  
living thee alone ill have 
and when dead ill be thy grave 
thro the heaven and earth and hell          
thou shalt never quell   
i will fly and thou pursue   
night and morn the flight renew   
poor pale pitiable form 
that i follow in a storm         
iron tears and groans of lead 
bind around my aching head   
love  lift me up upon thy golden wings  
from this base world unto thy heavens hight   
where i may see those admirable things 
which there thou workest by thy soveraine might   
farre above feeble reach of earthly sight           
that i thereof an heavenly hymne may sing 
unto the god of love high heavens king 
many lewd layes ah woe is me the more 
in praise of that mad fit which fooles call love  
i have in th heate of youth made heretofore           
that in light wits did loose affection move 
but all these follies now i do reprove   
and turned have the tenor of my string   
the heavenly prayses of true love to sing   
and ye that wont with greedy vaine desire           
to reade my fault and wondring at my flame   
to warme yourselves at my wide sparckling fire 
sith now that heat is quenched quench my blame   
and in her ashes shrowd my dying shame   
for who my passed follies now pursewes           
beginnes his owne and my old fault renewes 
before this worlds great frame in which al things   
are now contained found any beingplace 
ere flitting time could wag his eyas wings   
about that mightie bound which doth embrace          
the rolling spheres and parts their houres by space 
that high eternall powre which now doth move   
in all these things movd in its selfe by love   
it lovd it selfe because it selfe was faire  
for fair is lovd and of it self begot         
like to it selfe his eldest sonne and heire 
eternall pure and voide of sinfull blot   
the firstling of his ioy in whom no iot  
of loves dislike or pride was to be found  
whom he therefore with equall honour crownd           
with him he raignd before all time prescribed   
in endlesse glorie and immortall might   
together with that third from them derived  
most wise most holy most almightie spright   
whose kingdomes throne no thoughts of earthly wight          
can comprehend much lesse my trembling verse   
with equall words can hope it to reherse 
yet o most blessed spright pure lampe of light  
eternall spring of grace and wisedom trew   
vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright          
some little drop of thy celestiall dew   
that may my rymes with sweet infuse embrew  
and give me words equall unto my thought 
to tell the marveiles by thy mercie wrought 
yet being pregnant still with powrefull grace          
and full of fruitfull love that loves to get   
things like himselfe and to enlarge his race  
his second brood though not of powre so great 
yet full of beautie next he did beget 
an infinite increase of angels bright         
all glistring glorious in their makers light  
to them the heavens illimitable hight 
not this round heaven which we from hence behold   
adornd with thousand lamps of burning light   
and with ten thousand gemmes of shyning gold           
he gave as their inheritance to hold  
that they might serve him in eternall blis  
and be partakers of these ioyes of his   
there they in their trinall triplicities  
about him wait and on his will depend           
either with nimble wings to cut the skies   
when he them on his messages doth send   
or on his owne dread presence to attend  
where they behold the glorie of his light   
and caroll hymnes of love both day and night           
both day and night is unto them all one  
for he his beames doth unto them extend  
that darknesse there appeareth never none   
ne hath their day ne hath their blisse an end   
but there their termelesse time in pleasure spend         
ne ever should their happinesse decay 
had not they dard their lord to disobay 
but pride impatient of long resting peace  
did puffe them up with greedy bold ambition 
that they gan cast their state how to increase          
above the fortune of their first condition  
and sit in gods own seat without commission   
the brightest angel even the child of light   
drew millions more against their god to fight  
th almighty seeing their so bold assay         
kindled the flame of his consuming yre   
and with his onely breath them blew away  
from heavens hight to which they did aspyre  
to deepest hell and lake of damned fyre  
where they in darknesse and dread horror dwell         
hating the happie light from which they fell   
so that next offspring of the makers love 
next to himselfe in glorious degree   
degendering to hate fell from above   
through pride for pride and love may ill agree         
and now of sinne to all ensample bee  
how then can sinnful flesh it selfe assure  
sith purest angels fell to be impure  
but that eternall fount of love and grace   
still flowing forth his goodnesse unto all          
now seeing left a waste and emptie place  
in his wyde pallace through those angels fall   
cast to supply the same and to enstall   
a new unknowen colony therein   
whose root from earths base groundworke should begin           
therefore of clay base vile and next to nought 
yet formd by wondrous skill and by his might  
according to an heavenly patterne wrought   
which he had fashioned in his wise foresight   
he man did make and breathd a living spright          
into his face most beautifull and fayre 
endewd with wisedomes riches heavenly rare  
such he him made that he resemble might  
himselfe as mortall thing immortall could  
him to be lord of every living wight           
he made by love out of his owne like mould  
in whom he might his mightie selfe behould  
for love doth love the thing belovd to see 
that like it selfe in lovely shape may bee  
but man forgetfull of his makers grace          
no lesse than angels whom he did ensew  
fell from the hope of promist heavenly place 
into the mouth of death to sinners dew  
and all his offspring into thraldome threw  
where they for ever should in bonds remaine          
of neverdead yet everdying paine 
till that great lord of love which him at first   
made of meere love and after liked well 
seeing him lie like creature long accurst 
in that deep horror of despeyred hell         
him wretch in doole would let no longer dwell   
but cast out of that bondage to redeeme  
and pay the price all were his debt extreeme  
out of the bosome of eternall blisse  
in which he reigned with his glorious syre          
he downe descended like a most demisse   
and abiect thrall in fleshes fraile attyre 
that he for him might pay sinnes deadly hyre  
and him restore unto that happie state 
in which he stood before his haplesse fate          
in flesh at first the guilt committed was   
therefore in flesh it must be satisfyde  
nor spirit nor angel though they man surpas  
could make amends to god for mans misguyde 
but onely man himselfe who selfe did slyde         
so taking flesh of sacred virgins wombe   
for mans deare sake he did a man become 
and that most blessed bodie which was borne 
without all blemish or reprochfull blame 
he freely gave to be both rent and torne          
of cruell hands who with despightfull shame 
revyling him that them most vile became 
at length him nayled on a gallowtree 
and slew the lust by most uniust decree  
o huge and most unspeakeable impression           
of loves deep wound that pierst the piteous hart 
of that deare lord with so entyre affection 
and sharply launcing every inner part   
dolours of death into his soule did dart 
doing him die that never it deserved          
to free his foes that from his heast had swerved 
what hart can feel least touch of so sore launch  
or thought can think the depth of so deare wound  
whose bleeding sourse their streames yet never staunch  
but stil do flow and freshly still redownd         
to heale the sores of sinfull soules unsound   
and clense the guilt of that infected cryme  
which was enrooted in all fleshly slyme  
o blessed well of love o floure of grace   
o glorious morningstarre o lampe of light         
most lively image of thy fathers face   
eternal king of glorie lord of might 
meeke lambe of god before all worlds behight  
how can we thee requite for all this good   
or what can prize that thy most precious blood         
yet nought thou askst in lieu of all this love   
but love of us for guerdon of thy paine 
ay me what can us lesse than that behove   
had he required life for us againe 
had it beene wrong to ask his owne with gaine          
he gave us life he it restored lost  
then life were least that us so little cost   
but he our life hath left unto us free   
free that was thrall and blessed that was band   
ne ought demaunds but that we loving bee         
as he himselfe hath lovd us aforehand  
and bound therto with an eternall band   
him first to love that was so dearely bought   
and next our brethren to his image wrought 
him first to love great right and reason is         
who first to us our life and being gave  
and after when we fared had amisse   
us wretches from the second death did save  
and last the food of life which now we have  
even he himselfe in his dear sacrament          
to feede our hungry soules unto us lent 
then next to love our brethren that were made 
of that selfe mould and that self makers hand   
that we and to the same againe shall fade  
where they shall have like heritage of land         
however here on higher steps we stand 
which also were with selfesame price redeemed  
that we however of us light esteemed 
and were they not yet since that loving lord   
commanded us to love them for his sake           
even for his sake and for his sacred word  
which in his last bequest he to us spake 
we should them love and with their needs partake 
knowing that whatsoeer to them we give 
we give to him by whom we all doe live           
such mercy he by his most holy reede   
unto us taught and to approve it trew   
ensampled it by his most righteous deede 
shewing us mercie miserable crew   
that we the like should to the wretches shew           
and love our brethren thereby to approve 
how much himselfe that loved us we love  
then rouze thyselfe o earth out of thy soyle 
in which thou wallowest like to filthy swyne   
and doest thy mynd in durty pleasures moyle         
unmindfull of that dearest lord of thyne 
lift up to him thy heavie clouded eyne   
that thou this soveraine bountie mayst behold  
and read through love his mercies manifold   
beginne from first where he encradled was           
in simple cratch wrapt in a wad of hay   
betweene the toylfull oxe and humble asse   
and in what rags and in how base aray   
the glory of our heavenly riches lay  
when him the silly shepheards came to see           
whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee 
from thence reade on the storie of his life 
his humble carriage his unfaulty wayes  
his cancred foes his fights his toyle his strife  
his paines his povertie his sharpe assayes           
through which he past his miserable dayes   
offending none and doing good to all  
yet being malist both by great and small 
and look at last how of most wretched wights   
he taken was betrayd and false accused         
how with most scornfull taunts and fell despights  
he was revyld disgrast and foule abused   
how scourgd how crownd how buffeted how brused 
and lastly how twixt robbers crucifyde   
with bitter wounds through hands through feet and syde           
then let thy flinty hart that feeles no paine 
empierced be with pittifull remorse   
and let thy bowels bleede in every vaine 
at sight of his most sacred heavenly corse  
so torne and mangled with malicious forse           
and let thy soule whose sins his sorrows wrought 
melt into teares and grone in grieved thought 
with sence whereof whilest so thy softened spirit 
is inly toucht and humbled with meeke zeale 
through meditation of his endlesse merit         
lift up thy mind to th author of thy weale 
and to his soveraine mercie doe appeale  
learne him to love that loved thee so deare 
and in thy brest his blessed image beare 
with all thy hart with all thy soule and mind         
thou must him love and his beheasts embrace   
all other loves with which the world doth blind   
weake fancies and stirre up affections base   
thou must renounce and utterly displace  
and give thyselfe unto him full and free         
that full and freely gave himselfe to thee  
   to the assembled folk   
at great st kavins spoke 
young brother amiel on christmas eve  
i give you joy my friends   
that as the round year ends          
we meet once more for gladness by gods leave  
on other festal days 
for penitence or praise 
or prayer we meet or fullness of thanksgiving 
tonight we calendar        
the rising of that star 
which lit the old world with new joy of living 
ah we disparage still  
the tidings of good will  
discrediting loves gospel now as then          
and with the verbal creed  
that god is love indeed   
who dares make love his god before all men  
shall we not therefore friends   
resolve to make amends         
to that glad inspiration of the heart 
to grudge not to cast out 
selfishness malice doubt   
anger and fear and for the better part  
to love so much so well         
the spirit cannot tell  
the range and sweep of her own boundary  
there is no period   
between the soul and god  
love is the tide god the eternal sea          
today we walk by love 
to strive is not enough   
save against greed and ignorance and might  
we apprehend peace comes   
not with the roll of drums          
but in the still processions of the night   
and we perceive not awe   
but love is the great law  
that binds the world together safe and whole   
the splendid planets run          
their courses in the sun  
love is the gravitation of the soul   
in the profound unknown   
illumined fair and lone 
each star is set to shimmer in its place        
in the profound divine  
each soul is set to shine 
and its unique appointed orbit trace  
there is no near nor far  
where glorious algebar         
swings round his mighty circuit through the night 
yet where without a sound  
the winged seed comes to ground 
and the red leaf seems hardly to alight  
one force one lore one need        
for satellite and seed 
in the serene benignity for all 
letting her timeglass run 
with stardust sun by sun   
in natures thought there is no great nor small          
there is no far nor near   
within the spirits sphere   
the summer sunsets scarletyellow wings  
are tinged with the same dye  
that paints the tulips ply         
and what is colour but the soul of things   
the earth was without form  
god moulded it with storm 
ice flood and tempest gleaming tint and hue 
lest it should come to ill        
for lack of spirit still  
he gave it colourlet the love shine through   
of old men said sin not   
by every line and jot   
ye shall abide mans heart is false and vile        
christ said by love alone   
in mans heart is god known  
obey the word no falsehood can defile  
and since that day we prove   
only how great is love        
nor to this hour its greatness half believe 
for to what other power 
will life give equal dower   
or chaos grant one moment of reprieve 
look down the ages line         
where slowly the divine 
evinces energy puts forth control 
see mighty love alone   
transmuting stock and stone  
infusing being helping sense and soul          
and what is energy  
inworking which bids be  
the starry pageant and the life of earth 
what is the genesis  
of every joy and bliss        
each action dared each beauty brought to birth   
what hangs the sun on high   
what swells the growing rye  
what bids the loons cry on the northern lake   
what stirs in swamp and swale         
when april winds prevail  
and all the dwellers of the ground awake   
   o nectar o delicious stream 
      o ravishing and only pleasure where   
      shall such another theme   
inspire my tongue with joys or please mine ear 
      abridgement of delights           
        and queen of sights  
o mine of rarities o kingdom wide 
o more o cause of all o glorious bride 
  o god o bride of god o king 
  o soul and crown of everything          
    did not i covet to behold 
some endless monarch that did always live   
    in palaces of gold 
willing all kingdoms realms and crowns to give   
    unto my soul whose love         
      a spring might prove 
of endless glories honours friendships pleasures  
joys praises beauties and celestial treasures   
  lo now i see theres such a king   
  the fountainhead of everything         
    did my ambition ever dream   
of such a lord of such a love did i  
    expect so sweet a stream  
as this at any time could any eye  
    believe it why all power        
      is used here  
joys down from heaven on my head do shower  
and jove beyond the fiction doth appear   
  once more in golden rain to come  
  to danaes pleasing fruitful womb          
love lift me up upon thy golden wings   
from this base world unto thy heavens hight 
where i may see those admirable things 
which there thou workest by thy soveraine might   
farre above feeble reach of earthly sight           
that i thereof an heavenly hymne may sing 
unto the god of love high heavens king  
many lewd layes ah woe is me the more 
in praise of that mad fit which fooles call love  
i have in th heat of youth made heretofore         
that in light wits did loose affection move 
but all those follies now i do reprove   
and turned have the tenor of my string   
the heavenly prayses of true love to sing   
and ye that wont with greedy vaine desire         
to reade my fault and wondring at my flame 
to warme your selves at my wide sparckling fire   
sith now that heat is quenched quench my blame   
and in her ashes shrowd my dying shame   
for who my passed follies now pursewes           
beginnes his owne and my old fault renewes 
before this worlds great frame in which al things 
are now containd found any being place  
ere flitting time could wag his eyas wings   
about that mightie bound which doth embrace         
the rolling spheres and parts their houres by space 
that high eternall powre which now doth move   
in all these things movd in it selfe by love 
it lovd it selfe because it selfe was faire  
for faire is lovd and of it selfe begot          
like to it selfe his eldest sonne and heire 
eternall pure and voide of sinfull blot   
the firstling of his joy in whom no jot  
of loves dislike or pride was to be found   
whom he therefore with equall honour crownd         
with him he raignd before all time prescribed 
in endlesse glorie and immortall might   
together with that third from them derived  
most wise most holy most almightie spright   
whose kingdomes throne no thought of earthly wight         
can comprehend much lesse my trembling verse   
with equall words can hope it to reherse 
yet o most blessed spirit pure lampe of light   
eternall spring of grace and wisedome trew  
vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright          
some little drop of thy celestiall dew   
that may my rymes with sweet infuse embrew  
and give me words equall unto my thought 
to tell the marveiles by thy mercie wrought 
yet being pregnant still with powrefull grace          
and full of fruitfull love that loves to get   
things like himselfe and to enlarge his race  
his second brood though not in powre so great 
yet full of beautie next he did beget   
an infinite increase of angels bright         
all glistring glorious in their makers light   
to them the heavens illimitable hight  
not this round heaven which we from hence behold   
adornd with thousand lamps of burning light 
and with ten thousand gemmes of shyning gold           
he gave as their inheritance to hold  
that they might serve him in eternall blis  
and be partakers of those joyes of his   
there they in their trinall triplicities  
about him wait and on his will depend           
either with nimble wings to cut the skies   
when he them on his messages doth send   
or on his owne dread presence to attend  
where they behold the glorie of his light   
and caroll hymnes of love both day and night           
both day and night is unto them all one  
for he his beames doth still to them extend 
that darknesse there appeareth never none   
ne hath their day ne hath their blisse an end 
but there their termelesse time in pleasure spend         
ne ever should their happinesse decay 
had not they dard their lord to disobay 
but pride impatient of long resting peace  
did puffe them up with greedy bold ambition 
that they gan cast their state how to increase          
above the fortune of their first condition  
and sit in gods owne seat without commission   
the brightest angell even the child of light  
drew millions more against their god to fight  
th almighty seeing their so bold assay         
kindled the flame of his consuming yre   
and with his onely breath them blew away  
from heavens hight to which they did aspyre   
to deepest hell and lake of damned fyre 
where they in darknesse and dread horror dwell         
hating the happie light from which they fell   
so that next offspring of the makers love  
next to himselfe in glorious degree   
degendering to hate fell from above   
through pride for pride and love may ill agree          
and now of sinne to all ensample bee  
how then can sinfull flesh it selfe assure  
sith purest angels fell to be impure  
but that eternall fount of love and grace   
still flowing forth his goodnesse unto all          
now seeing left a waste and emptie place  
in his wyde pallace through those angels fall 
cast to supply the same and to enstall   
a new unknowen colony therein   
whose root from earths base ground worke shold begin         
therefore of clay base vile and next to nought 
yet formd by wondrous skill and by his might 
according to an heavenly patterne wrought   
which he had fashiond in his wise foresight 
he man did make and breathd a living spright           
into his face most beautifull and fayre  
endewd with wisedomes riches heavenly rare   
such he him made that he resemble might  
himselfe as mortall thing immortall could  
him to be lord of every living wight           
he made by love out of his owne like mould  
in whom he might his mightie selfe behould  
for love doth love the thing belovd to see 
that like it selfe in lovely shape may bee  
but man forgetfull of his makers grace          
no lesse then angels whom he did ensew  
fell from the hope of promist heavenly place   
into the mouth of death to sinners dew  
and all his offspring into thraldome threw 
where they for ever should in bonds remaine          
of never dead yet ever dying paine   
till that great lord of love which him at first   
made of meere love and after liked well 
seeing him lie like creature long accurst 
in that deepe horror of despeyred hell           
him wretch in doole would let no lenger dwell   
but cast out of that bondage to redeeme  
and pay the price all were his debt extreeme  
out of the bosome of eternall blisse  
in which he reigned with his glorious syre          
he downe descended like a most demisse   
and abject thrall in fleshes fraile attyre 
that he for him might pay sinnes deadly hyre   
and him restore unto that happie state 
in which he stood before his haplesse fate          
in flesh at first the guilt committed was   
therefore in flesh it must be satisfyde  
nor spirit nor angell though they man surpas 
could make amends to god for mans misguyde  
but onely man himselfe who selfe did slyde         
so taking flesh of sacred virgins wombe 
for mans deare sake he did a man become  
and that most blessed bodie which was borne 
without all blemish or reprochfull blame 
he freely gave to be both rent and torne          
of cruell hands who with despightfull shame 
revyling him that them most vile became 
at length him nayled on a gallow tree 
and slew the just by most unjust decree  
o huge and most unspeakeable impression           
of loves deepe wound that pierst the piteous hart 
of that deare lord with so entyre affection 
and sharply launching every inner part   
dolours of death into his soule did dart 
doing him die that never it deserved         
to free his foes that from his heast had swerved 
what hart can feele least touch of so sore launch 
or thought can think the depth of so deare wound  
whose bleeding sourse their streames yet never staunch  
but stil do flow and freshly still redound         
to heale the sores of sinfull soules unsound   
and clense the guilt of that infected cryme 
which was enrooted in all fleshly slyme  
o blessed well of love o floure of grace   
o glorious morning starre o lampe of light         
most lively image of thy fathers face 
eternall king of glorie lord of might   
meeke lambe of god before all worlds behight  
how can we thee requite for all this good   
or what can prize that thy most precious blood         
yet nought thou askst in lieu of all this love   
but love of us for guerdon of thy paine 
ay me what can us lesse then that behove   
had he required life of us againe  
had it beene wrong to aske his owne with gaine         
he gave us life he it restored lost  
then life were least that us so litle cost 
but he our life hath left unto us free   
free that was thrall and blessed that was band   
ne ought demaunds but that we loving bee           
as he himselfe hath lovd us afore hand  
and bound therto with an eternall band   
him first to love that us so dearely bought   
and next our brethren to his image wrought   
him first to love great right and reason is           
who first to us our life and being gave  
and after when we fared had amisse   
us wretches from the second death did save  
and last the food of life which now we have  
even himselfe in his deare sacrament          
to feede our hungry soules unto us lent 
then next to love our brethren that were made 
of that selfe mould and that selfe makers hand  
that we and to the same againe shall fade  
where they shall have like heritage of land         
how ever here on higher steps we stand   
which also were with selfe same price redeemed  
that we how ever of us light esteemed   
and were they not yet since that loving lord   
commaunded us to love them for his sake          
even for his sake and for his sacred word  
which in his last bequest he to us spake 
we should them love and with their needs partake 
knowing that whatsoere to them we give   
we give to him by whom we all doe live          
such mercy he by his most holy reede   
unto us taught and to approve it trew   
ensampled it by his most righteous deede 
shewing us mercie miserable crew  
that we the like should to the wretches shew           
and love our brethren thereby to approve 
how much himselfe that loved us we love   
then rouze thy selfe o earth out of thy soyle   
in which thou wallowest like to filthy swyne   
and doest thy mynd in durty pleasures moyle         
unmindfull of that dearest lord of thyne 
lift up to him thy heavie clouded eyne   
that thou his soveraine bountie mayst behold   
and read through love his mercies manifold  
beginne from first where he encradled was           
in simple cratch wrapt in a wad of hay  
betweene the toylefull oxe and humble asse  
and in what rags and in how base aray   
the glory of our heavenly riches lay  
when him the silly shepheards came to see           
whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee 
from thence reade on the storie of his life 
his humble carriage his unfaulty wayes  
his cancred foes his fights his toyle his strife  
his paines his povertie his sharpe assayes         
through which he past his miserable dayes   
offending none and doing good to all 
yet being malist both of great and small 
and looke at last how of most wretched wights  
he taken was betrayd and false accused         
how with most scornefull taunts and fell despights  
he was revyld disgrast and foule abused   
how scourgd how crownd how buffeted how brused 
and lastly how twixt robbers crucifyde  
with bitter wounds through hands through feet and syde           
then let thy flinty hart that feeles no paine 
empierced be with pittifull remorse   
and let thy bowels bleede in every vaine 
at sight of his most sacred heavenly corse  
so torne and mangled with malicious forse           
and let thy soule whose sins his sorrows wrought 
melt into teares and grone in grieved thought 
love is anterior to life  
  posterior to death   
initial of creation and   
  the exponent of breath  
i playd with you mid cowslips blowing   
  when i was six and you were four  
when garlands weaving flowerballs throwing    
  were pleasures soon to please no more   
through groves and meads oer grass and heather           
  with little playmates to and fro    
we wanderd hand in hand together   
  but that was sixty years ago   
you grew a lovely roseate maiden    
  and still our early love was strong   
still with no care our days were laden    
  they glided joyously along  
and i did love you very dearly   
  how dearly words want power to show  
i thought your heart was touchd as nearly    
  but that was fifty years ago   
then other lovers came around you   
  your beauty grew from year to year   
and many a splendid circle found you    
  the centre of its glimmering sphere   
i saw you then first vows forsaking   
  on rank and wealth your hand bestow  
o then i thought my heart was breaking  
  but that was forty years ago   
from the fourth book translated by john dryden
thus therefore he who feels the fiery dart 
of strong desire transfix his amorous heart 
whether some beauteous boys alluring face  
or lovelier maid with unresisting grace 
from her each part the winged arrow sends           
from whence he first was struck he thither tends  
restless he roams impatient to be freed 
and eager to inject the sprightly seed   
for fierce desire does all his mind employ  
and ardent love assures approaching joy          
such is the nature of that pleasing smart   
whose burning drops distil upon the heart   
the fever of the soul shot from the fair 
and the cold ague of succeeding care  
if absent her idea still appears          
and her sweet name is chiming in your ears  
but strive those pleasing phantoms to remove   
and shun the aerial images of love 
that feed the flame when one molests thy mind 
discharge thy loins on all the leaky kind           
for thats a wiser way than to restrain   
within thy swelling nerves that hoard of pain  
for every hour some deadlier symptom shows  
and by delay the gathering venom grows   
when kindly applications are not used         
the viper love must on the wound be bruised  
on that one object tis not safe to stay 
but force the tide of thought some other way   
the squandered spirits prodigally throw  
and in the common globe of nature sow         
nor wants he all the bliss that lovers feign   
who takes the pleasure and avoids the pain 
for purer joys in purer health abound 
and less affect the sickly than the sound   
  when love its utmost vigor does employ         
even then tis but a restless wandering joy 
nor knows the lover in that wild excess  
with hands or eyes what first he would possess   
but strains at all and fastning where he strains  
too closely presses with his frantic pains          
with biting kisses hurts the twining fair   
which shows his joys imperfect insincere   
for stung with inward rage he flings around  
and strives to avenge the smart on that which gave the wound  
but love those eager bitings does restrain          
and mingling pleasure mollifies the pain 
for ardent hope still flatters anxious grief   
and sends him to his foe to seek relief  
which yet the nature of the thing denies 
for love and love alone of all our joys         
by full possession does but fan the fire 
the more we still enjoy the more we still desire 
nature for meat and drink provides a space  
and when received they fill their certain place 
hence thirst and hunger may be satisfied         
but this repletion is to love denied  
form feature colour whatsoeer delight 
provokes the lovers endless appetite 
these fill no space nor can we thence remove   
with lips or hands or all our instruments of love          
in our deluded grasp we nothing find  
but thin aerial shapes that fleet before the mind   
as he who in a dream with drought is curst 
and finds no real drink to quench his thirst   
runs to imagined lakes his heat to steep         
and vainly swills and labors in his sleep   
so love with phantoms cheats our longing eyes  
which hourly seeing never satisfies   
our hands pull nothing from the parts they strain 
but wander oer the lovely limbs in vain         
nor when the youthful pair more closely join   
when hands in hands they lock and thighs in thighs they twine   
just in the raging foam of full desire   
when both press on both murmur both expire   
they grip they squeeze their humid tongues they dart          
as each would force their way to tothers heart  
in vain they only cruise about the coast   
for bodies cannot pierce nor be in bodies lost   
as sure they strive to be when both engage  
in that tumultuous momentary rage          
so tangled in the nets of love they lie 
till man dissolves in that excess of joy 
then when the gathered bag has burst its way  
and ebbing tides the slackened nerves betray   
a pause ensues and nature nods awhile           
till with recruited rage new spirits boil   
and then the same vain violence returns  
with flames renewed the erected furnace burns  
again they in each other would be lost   
but still by adamantine bars are crossed         
all ways they try successless all they prove  
to cure the secret sore of lingring love   
  besides 
they waste their strength in the venereal strife  
and to a womans will enslave their life         
the estate runs out and mortgages are made 
all offices of friendship are decayed 
their fortune ruined and their fame betrayed  
assyrian ointment from their temples flows  
and diamond buckles sparkle at their shoes          
the cheerful emerald twinkles on their hands   
with all the luxury of foreign lands  
and the blue coat that with embroidry shines 
is drunk with sweat of their oerlabored loins   
their frugal fathers gains they misemploy          
and turn to paint and pearl and evry female toy   
french fashions costly treats are their delight  
the park by day and plays and balls by night  
in vain  
for in the fountain where their sweets are sought           
some bitter bubbles up and poisons all the draught  
first guilty conscience does the mirror bring 
then sharp remorse shoots out her angry sting  
and anxious thoughts within themselves at strife 
upbraid the long misspent luxurious life           
perhaps the fickle fair one proves unkind  
or drops a doubtful word that pains his mind  
and leaves a rankling jealousy behind 
perhaps he watches close her amorous eyes  
and in the act of ogling does surprise           
and thinks he sees upon her cheeks the while 
the dimpled tracks of some foregoing smile  
his raging pulse beats thick and his pent spirits boil 
this is the product een of prosprous love 
think then what pangs disastrous passions prove           
innumerable ills disdain despair 
with all the meager family of care 
  thus as i said tis better to prevent   
than flatter the disease and late repent   
because to shun the allurement is not hard           
to minds resolved forewarned and well prepared  
but wondrous difficult when once beset  
to struggle through the straits and break the involving net  
yet thus ensnared thy freedom thou mayst gain  
if like a fool thou dost not hug thy chain           
if not to ruin obstinately blind   
and wilfully endeavoring not to find   
her plain defects of body and of mind 
for thus the bedlam train of lovers use   
t enhance the value and the faults excuse         
and therefore tis no wonder if we see 
they doat on dowdies and deformity 
een what they cannot praise they will not blame 
but veil with some extenuating name   
the sallow skin is for the swarthy put           
and love can make a slattern of a slut   
if cateyed then a pallas is their love 
if freckled shes a partycoloured dove 
if little then shes life and soul all oer   
an amazon the large twohanded whore         
she stammers oh what grace in lisping lies 
if she says nothing to be sure shes wise  
if shrill and with a voice to drown a choir   
sharpwitted she must be and full of fire  
the lean consumptive wench with coughs decayed          
is called a pretty tight and slender maid 
the oergrown a goodly ceres is exprest 
a bedfellow for bacchus at the least 
flatnose the name of satyr never misses 
and hanging blobber lips but pout for kisses           
the task were endless all the rest to trace 
yet grant she were a venus for her face   
and shape yet others equal beauty share 
and time was you could live without the fair   
she does no more in that for which you woo         
then homelier women full as well can do  
besides she daubs and stinks so much of paint   
her own attendants cannot bear the scent 
but laugh behind and bite their lips to hold  
meantime excluded and exposed to cold          
the whining lover stands before the gates   
and there with humble adoration waits 
crowning with flowers the threshold and the floor 
and printing kisses on the obdurate door 
who if admitted in that nick of time         
if some unsavry whiff betray the crime  
invents a quarrel straight if there be none   
or makes some faint excuses to be gone   
and calls himself a doting fool to serve 
ascribing more than woman can deserve         
which well they understand like cunning queens 
and hide their nastiness behind the scenes  
from him they have allured and would retain   
but to a piercing eye tis all in vain   
for common sense brings all their cheats to view          
and the false light discovers by the true   
which a wise harlot owns and hopes to find  
a pardon for defects that run thro all the kind 
  nor always do they feign the sweets of love  
when round the panting youth their pliant limbs they move          
and cling and heave and moisten evry kiss   
they often share and more than share the bliss   
from every part evn to their inmost soul   
they feel the trickling joys and run with vigor to the goal  
stirred with the same impetuous desire           
birds beasts and herds and mares their males require   
because the throbbing nature in their veins  
provokes them to assuage their kindly pains 
the lusty leap the expecting female stands  
by mutual heat compelled to mutual bands         
thus dogs with lolling tongues by love are tied   
nor shouting boys nor blows their union can divide   
at either end they strive the link to loose 
in vain for stronger venus holds the noose 
which never would those wretched lovers do          
but that the common heats of love they know 
the pleasure therefore must be shared in common too  
and when the womans more prevailing juice   
sucks in the mans the mixture will produce 
the mothers likeness when the man prevails           
his own resemblance in the seed he seals 
but when we see the newbegotten race  
reflect the features of each parents face  
then of the fathers and the mothers blood  
the justly tempered seed is understood           
when both conspire with equal ardor bent   
from every limb the due proportion sent  
when neither party foils when neither foiled  
this gives the blended features of the child   
sometimes the boy the grandsires image bears          
sometimes the more remote progenitor he shares 
because the genial atoms of the seed   
lie long concealed ere they exert the breed 
and after sundry ages past produce   
the tardy likeness of the latent juice           
hence families such different figures take 
and represent their ancestors in face and hair and make  
because of the same seed the voice and hair  
and shape and face and other members are  
and the same antique mold the likeness does prepare          
thus oft the fathers likeness does prevail  
in females and the mothers in the male 
for since the seed is of a double kind  
from that where we the most resemblance find   
we may conclude the strongest tincture sent         
and that was in conception prevalent  
  nor can the vain decrees of powers above   
deny production to the act of love 
or hinder fathers of that happy name  
or with a barren womb the matron shame           
as many think who stain with victims blood 
the mournful altars and with incense load  
to bless the showry seed with future life  
and to impregnate the welllaboured wife 
in vain they weary heaven with prayer or fly           
to oracles or magic numbers try   
for barrenness of sexes will proceed   
either from too condensed or watry seed 
the watry juice too soon dissolves away 
and in the parts projected will not stay         
the too condensed unsouled unwieldy mass  
drops short nor carries to the destined place 
nor pierces to the parts nor tho injected home 
will mingle with the kindly moisture of the womb  
for nuptials are alike in their success          
some men with fruitful seed some women bless   
and from some men some women fruitful are   
just as their constitutions join or jar  
and many seeming barren wives have been  
who after matched with more prolific men           
have filled a family with prattling boys 
and many not supplied at home with joys 
have found a friend abroad to ease their smart   
and to perform the sapless husbands part   
so much it does import that seed with seed           
should of the kindly mixture make the breed 
and thick with thin and thin with thick should join 
so to produce and propagate the line  
of such concernment too is drink and food   
to incrassate to attenuate the blood         
of like importance is the posture too 
in which the genial feat of love we do   
for as the females of the fourfoot kind 
receive the leapings of their males behind  
so the good wives with loins uplifted high         
and leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try 
for in that posture will they best conceive 
not when supinely laid they frisk and heave  
for active motions only break the blow   
and more of strumpets than of wives they show          
when answering stroke with stroke the mingled liquors flow  
endearments eager and too brisk a bound  
throws off the plowshare from the furrowed ground 
but common harlots in conjunction heave   
because tis less their business to conceive         
than to delight and to provoke the deed 
a trick which honest wives but little need  
now is it from the gods or cupids dart 
that many a homely woman takes the heart 
but wives wellhumored dutiful and chaste         
and clean will hold their wandring husbands fast   
such are the links of love and such a love will last   
for what remains long habitude and use 
will kindness in domestic bands produce  
for custom will a strong impression leave           
hard bodies which the lightest stroke receive 
in length of time will molder and decay  
and stones with drops of rain are washed away
and i lived on to wed another    
  no cause she gave me to repine    
and when i heard you were a mother  
  i did not wish the children mine  
my own young flock in fair progression   
  made up a pleasant christmas row   
my joy in them was past expression  
  but that was thirty years ago  
  having in the greener times of my youth composed these former two hymnes in the praise of love and beautie and finding that the same too much pleased those of like age and disposition which being too vehemently caried with that kind of affection do rather sucke out poyson to their strong passion then hony to their honest delight i was moved by the one of you two most excellent ladies to call in the same but being unable so to doe by reason that many copies thereof were formerly scattered abroad i resolved at least to amend and by way of retractation to reforme them making in stead of those two hymnes of earthly or naturall love and beautie two others of heavenly and celestiall the which i doe dedicate joyntly unto you two honorable sisters as to the most excellent and rare ornaments of all true love and beautie both in the one and the other kinde humbly beseeching you to vouchsafe the patronage of them and to accept this my humble service in lieu of the great graces and honourable favours which ye dayly shew unto me untill such time as i may by better meanes yeeld you some more notable testimonie of my thankfull mind and dutifull devotion

  the noblewomen to whom this volume is dedicated were sisters of the great russell family the lady margaret was that countess of cumberland to whom daniel a few years later addressed the most noble of his poems the countess of warwick whose name was anne not mary was the widow of leicesters brother the good earl and as such had found mention in the ruins of time
  the words of the dedication have been variously interpreted the first pair of hymns composed we read in the greener times of my youth by which we are to understand probably the period of the calendar and of mother hubberds tale having too much pleased those of like age and disposition were apparently in  still popular but one of the noble sisters disapproving of them would have them called in whereupon being unable so to doe the poet resolved at least to amend and by way of retractation to reforme them making in stead of those two hymns of earthly or naturall love and beautie two others of heavenly and celestiall the difficulty is in the final clauses did the poet besides composing the two later hymns also reduce the earlier to inoffensiveness or did he let these stand as originally written and atone for them merely by composing their substitutes at first it would seem as if the second interpretation though more in accord with the words of the letter were impossible for in the earlier hymns as they are printed there could surely be nothing to shock the most extravagant of prudes besides if the lady objected to them in their early form why should the poet publish them in that form yet if on the other hand these hymns as they are printed be the result of expurgation one does not see what the poet can have expurgated both are organically platonic there would seem to be no place in them at any point for matter even faintly licentious perhaps however it has been assumed too readily that the fault of these early hymns was of that kind dr grosart thinks that the sister who protested was the countess of warwick for she is known to have inclined to puritanism if it was she her protest may very well have been not against immodesty but against the very subject matter of these hymns earthly or naturall love and beautie she may have reprobated them for sinful vanities just as her nephew sidney being on his deathbed reprobated his own arcadia and gave earnest orders for its destruction in atonement for such a fault spenser might well issue the early hymns as they had been written and let their vanity be foil to the earnestness of the later composed to replace them his repentance would then be that of the december eclogue
         i that whilome wont to frame my pype
unto the shifting of the shepheards foote
sike follies nowe have gathered as too ripe
and cast hem out as rotten and unsoote
the loser lasse rosalind i cast to please nomore
one if i please i e god enough is me therefore
the later repentance certainly need not be taken as at all more serious than the earlier need not be read as an example of the sensitive purity of the poets nature in composing his first two hymns he had aimed to embody in verse some of those neoplatonic doctrines which were then so popular in italy best known to englishmen perhaps in the fourth book of castigliones courtier his success had been the more brilliant in that he was first in england to occupy the field later when the countess of warwick would have persuaded him that such vanities were unworthy of a sage and serious poet one can understand how he might acquiesce and without very real contrition for these youthful hymns gratify her by others more in consonance with her convictions for the neoplatonic modes of thought were as applicable to christian doctrine as to theories of earthly or naturall love and beautie and a poet might be sincere in both uses since neither would be understood literally and since both embodied the spirit of his most serious thought
an hymne in honour of love
love that long since hast to thy mighty powre  
perforce subdude my poore captived hart  
and raging now therein with restlesse stowre   
doest tyrannize in everie weaker part 
faine would i seeke to ease my bitter smart          
by any service i might do to thee  
or ought that else might to thee pleasing bee  
and now t asswage the force of this new flame 
and make thee more propitious in my need 
i meane to sing the praises of thy name          
and thy victorious conquests to areed 
by which thou madest many harts to bleed  
of mighty victors with wyde wounds embrewed   
and by thy cruell darts to thee subdewed 
onely i feare my wits enfeebled late          
through the sharpe sorrowes which thou hast me bred  
should faint and words should faile me to relate  
the wondrous triumphs of thy great godhed   
but if thou wouldst vouchsafe to overspred  
me with the shadow of thy gentle wing         
i should enabled be thy actes to sing 
come then o come thou mightie god of love 
out of thy silver bowres and secret blisse  
where thou doest sit in venus lap above  
bathing thy wings in her ambrosiall kisse           
that sweeter farre then any nectar is 
come softly and my feeble breast inspire 
with gentle furie kindled of thy fire   
and ye sweet muses which have often proved 
the piercing points of his avengefull darts         
and ye faire nimphs which oftentimes have loved  
the cruell worker of your kindly smarts  
prepare your selves and open wide your harts  
for to receive the triumph of your glorie   
that made you merie oft when ye were sorie         
and ye faire blossomes of youths wanton breed 
which in the conquests of your beautie bost 
wherewith your lovers feeble eyes you feed  
but sterve their harts that needeth nourture most   
prepare your selves to march amongst his host          
and all the way this sacred hymne do sing   
made in the honor of your soveraigne king   
great god of might that reignest in the mynd  
and all the bodie to thy hest doest frame   
victor of gods subduer of mankynd         
that doest the lions and fell tigers tame   
making their cruell rage thy scornefull game   
and in their roring taking great delight 
who can expresse the glorie of thy might 
or who alive can perfectly declare          
the wondrous cradle of thine infancie 
when thy great mother venus first thee bare 
begot of plentie and of penurie 
though elder then thine owne nativitie   
and yet a chyld renewing still thy yeares          
and yet the eldest of the heavenly peares   
for ere this worlds still moving mightie masse  
out of great chaos ugly prison crept  
in which his goodly face long hidden was  
from heavens view and in deepe darknesse kept         
love that had now long time securely slept  
in venus lap unarmed then and naked  
gan reare his head by clotho being waked   
and taking to him wings of his owne heate   
kindled at first from heavens lifegiving fyre         
he gan to move out of his idle seate  
weakely at first but after with desyre   
lifted aloft he gan to mount up hyre 
and like fresh eagle make his hardie flight 
through all that great wide wast yet wanting light          
yet wanting light to guide his wandring way 
his owne faire mother for all creatures sake  
did lend him light from her owne goodly ray 
then through the world his way he gan to take  
the world that was not till he did it make         
whose sundrie parts he from them selves did sever 
the which before had lyen confused ever  
the earth the ayre the water and the fyre   
then gan to raunge them selves in huge array   
and with contrary forces to conspyre           
each against other by all meanes they may  
threatning their owne confusion and decay   
ayre hated earth and water hated fyre   
till love relented their rebellious yre  
he then them tooke and tempering goodly well           
their contrary dislikes with loved meanes   
did place them all in order and compell  
to keepe them selves within their sundrie raines  
together linkt with adamantine chaines   
yet so as that in every living wight           
they mixe themselves and shew their kindly might 
so ever since they firmely have remained 
and duly well observed his beheast 
through which now all these things that are contained 
within this goodly cope both most and least           
their being have and dayly are increast  
through secret sparks of his infused fyre   
which in the barraine cold he doth inspyre  
thereby they all do live and moved are   
to multiply the likenesse of their kynd          
whilest they seeke onely without further care 
to quench the flame which they in burning fynd 
but man that breathes a more immortall mynd   
not for lusts sake but for eternitie 
seekes to enlarge his lasting progenie           
for having yet in his deducted spright 
some sparks remaining of that heavenly fyre 
he is enlumind with that goodly light 
unto like goodly semblant to aspyre   
therefore in choice of love he doth desyre          
that seemes on earth most heavenly to embrace 
that same is beautie borne of heavenly race   
for sure of all that in this mortall frame  
contained is nought more divine doth seeme 
or that resembleth more th immortall flame          
of heavenly light then beauties glorious beame   
what wonder then if with such rage extreme  
fraile men whose eyes seek heavenly things to see   
at sight thereof so much enravisht bee   
which well perceiving that imperious boy         
doth therwith tip his sharp empoisned darts 
which glancing through the eyes with countenance coy   
rest not till they have pierst the trembling harts   
and kindled flame in all their inner parts  
which suckes the blood and drinketh up the lyfe           
of carefull wretches with consuming griefe  
thenceforth they playne and make ful piteous mone 
unto the author of their balefull bane   
the daies they waste the nights they grieve and grone  
their lives they loath and heavens light disdaine           
no light but that whose lampe doth yet remaine  
fresh burning in the image of their eye  
they deigne to see and seeing it still dye 
the whylst thou tyrant love doest laugh and scorne  
at their complaints making their paine thy play          
whylest they lye languishing like thrals forlorne 
the whyles thou doest triumph in their decay   
and otherwhyles their dying to delay 
thou doest emmarble the proud hart of her   
whose love before their life they doe prefer           
so hast thou often done ay me the more 
to me thy vassall whose yet bleeding hart   
with thousand wounds thou mangled hast so sore  
that whole remaines scarse any little part  
yet to augment the anguish of my smart           
thou hast enfrosen her disdainefull brest   
that no one drop of pitie there doth rest   
why then do i this honor unto thee 
thus to ennoble thy victorious name   
since thou doest shew no favour unto mee         
ne once move ruth in that rebellious dame   
somewhat to slacke the rigour of my flame   
certes small glory doest thou winne hereby  
to let her live thus free and me to dy  
but if thou be indeede as men thee call         
the worlds great parent the most kind preserver   
of living wights the soveraine lord of all 
how falles it then that with thy furious fervour   
thou doest afflict as well the not deserver 
as him that doeth thy lovely heasts despize         
and on thy subjects most doest tyrannize 
yet herein eke thy glory seemeth more 
by so hard handling those which best thee serve   
that ere thou doest them unto grace restore 
thou mayest well trie if they will ever swerve         
and mayest them make it better to deserve   
and having got it may it more esteeme   
for things hard gotten men more dearely deeme  
so hard those heavenly beauties be enfyred  
as things divine least passions doe impresse           
the more of stedfast mynds to be admyred 
the more they stayed be on stedfastnesse 
but baseborne mynds such lamps regard the lesse   
which at first blowing take not hastie fyre 
such fancies feele no love but loose desyre           
for love is lord of truth and loialtie   
lifting himselfe out of the lowly dust 
on golden plumes up to the purest skie   
above the reach of loathly sinfull lust  
whose base affect through cowardly distrust         
of his weake wings dare not to heaven fly  
but like a moldwarpe in the earth doth ly   
his dunghill thoughts which do themselves enure   
to dirtie drosse no higher dare aspyre  
ne can his feeble earthly eyes endure          
the flaming light of that celestiall fyre   
which kindleth love in generous desyre   
and makes him mount above the native might   
of heavie earth up to the heavens hight 
such is the powre of that sweet passion          
that it all sordid basenesse doth expell 
and the refyned mynd doth newly fashion   
unto a fairer forme which now doth dwell 
in his high thought that would it selfe excell   
which he beholding still with constant sight           
admires the mirrour of so heavenly light 
whose image printing in his deepest wit  
he thereon feeds his hungrie fantasy  
still full yet never satisfyde with it  
like tantale that in store doth sterved ly         
so doth he pine in most satiety 
for nought may quench his infinite desyre   
once kindled through that first conceived fyre 
thereon his mynd affixed wholly is 
ne thinks on ought but how it to attaine           
his care his joy his hope is all on this  
that seemes in it all blisses to containe   
in sight whereof all other blisse seemes vaine 
thrise happie man might he the same possesse  
he faines himselfe and doth his fortune blesse           
and though he do not win his wish to end 
yet thus farre happie he him selfe doth weene  
that heavens such happie grace did to him lend 
as thing on earth so heavenly to have seene 
his harts enshrined saint his heavens queene          
fairer then fairest in his fayning eye  
whose sole aspect he counts felicitye 
then forth he casts in his unquiet thought  
what he may do her favour to obtaine 
what brave exploit what perill hardly wrought         
what puissant conquest what adventurous paine 
may please her best and grace unto him gaine  
he dreads no danger nor misfortune feares  
his faith his fortune in his breast he beares   
thou art his god thou art his mightie guyde           
thou being blind letst him not see his feares   
but cariest him to that which he hath eyde  
through seas through flames through thousand swords and speares   
ne ought so strong that may his force withstand   
with which thou armest his resistlesse hand         
witnesse leander in the euxine waves  
and stout neas in the trojane fyre   
achilles preassing through the phrygian glaives   
and orpheus daring to provoke the yre  
of damned fiends to get his love retyre         
for both through heaven and hell thou makest way  
to win them worship which to thee obay   
and if by all these perils and these paynes  
he may but purchase lyking in her eye 
what heavens of joy then to himselfe he faynes         
eftsoones he wypes quite out of memory 
what ever ill before he did aby 
had it bene death yet would he die againe  
to live thus happie as her grace to gaine   
yet when he hath found favour to his will           
he nathemore can so contented rest 
but forceth further on and striveth still   
t approch more neare till in her inmost brest 
he may embosomd bee and loved best   
and yet not best but to be lovd alone          
for love can not endure a paragone 
the feare whereof o how doth it torment  
his troubled mynd with more then hellish paine 
and to his fayning fansie represent 
sights never seene and thousand shadowes vaine           
to breake his sleepe and waste his ydle braine 
thou that hast never lovd canst not beleeve 
least part of th evils which poore lovers greeve 
the gnawing envie the hartfretting feare  
the vaine surmizes the distrustfull showes         
the false reports that flying tales doe beare  
the doubts the daungers the delayes the woes   
the fayned friends the unassured foes   
with thousands more then any tongue can tell   
doe make a lovers life a wretches hell           
yet is there one more cursed then they all  
that cancker worme that monster gelosie 
which eates the hart and feedes upon the gall 
turning all loves delight to miserie  
through feare of loosing his felicitie           
ah gods that ever ye that monster placed   
in gentle love that all his joyes defaced  
by these o love thou doest thy entrance make  
unto thy heaven and doest the more endeere  
thy pleasures unto those which them partake         
as after stormes when clouds begin to cleare  
the sunne more bright and glorious doth appeare   
so thou thy folke through paines of purgatorie   
dost beare unto thy blisse and heavens glorie 
o talk not to me of a name great in story    
the days of our youth are the days of our glory    
and the myrtle and ivy of sweet twoandtwenty   
are worth all your laurels though ever so plenty  
what are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled           
tis but as a dead flower with maydew besprinkled    
then away with all such from the head that is hoary   
what care i for the wreaths that can only give glory  
o fame if i eer took delight in thy praises   
twas less for the sake of thy highsounding phrases   
than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover   
she thought that i was not unworthy to love her    
there chiefly i sought thee there only i found thee  
her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee   
when it sparkled oer aught that was bright in my story   
i knew it was love and i felt it was glory  
there thou them placest in a paradize          
of all delight and joyous happie rest 
where they doe feede on nectar heavenly wize   
with hercules and hebe and the rest   
of venus dearlings through her bountie blest  
and lie like gods in yvorie beds arayd           
with rose and lillies over them displayd 
from paradise lost book viii
mine eyes he closed but open left the cell  
of fancy my internal sight by which  
abstract as in a trance methought i saw   
though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape 
still glorious before whom awake i stood         
who stooping opened my left side and took 
from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm   
and lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound   
but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed   
the rib he formed and fashioned with his hands         
under his forming hands a creature grew  
manlike but different sex so lovely fair  
that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now  
mean or in her summed up in her contained 
and in her looks which from that time infused          
sweetness into my heart unfelt before   
and into all things from her air inspired 
the spirit of love and amorous delight   
she disappeared and left me dark i waked   
to find her or forever to deplore          
her loss and other pleasures all abjure 
when out of hope behold her not far off   
such as i saw her in my dream adorned 
with what all earth or heaven could bestow   
to make her amiable on she came           
led by her heavenly maker though unseen 
and guided by his voice nor uninformed   
of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites   
grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye  
in every gesture dignity and love          
i overjoyed could not forbear aloud 
  this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled 
thy words creator bounteous and benign  
giver of all things fair but fairest this   
of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see          
bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself   
before me woman is her name of man   
extracted for this cause he shall forego 
father and mother and to his wife adhere   
and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul         
  she heard me thus and though divinely brought  
yet innocence and virgin modesty   
her virtue and the conscience of her worth  
that would be wooed and not unsought be won   
not obvious not obtrusive but retired          
the more desirable or to say all 
nature herself though pure of sinful thought  
wrought in her so that seeing me she turned 
i followed her she what was honor knew  
and with obsequious majesty approved           
my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower   
i led her blushing like the morn all heaven   
and happy constellations on that hour  
shed their selectest influence the earth 
gave sign of gratulation and each hill          
joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs   
whispered it to the woods and from their wings 
flung rose flung odors from the spicy shrub   
disporting till the amorous bird of night   
sung spousal and bid haste the evening star         
on his hilltop to light the bridal lamp
                                
                        when i approach   
her loveliness so absolute she seems 
and in herself complete so well to know  
her own that what she wills to do or say 
seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best           
all higher knowledge in her presence falls   
degraded wisdom in discourse with her 
loses discountenanced and like folly shows 
authority and reason on her wait   
as one intended first not after made          
occasionally and to consummate all  
greatness of mind and nobleness their seat   
build in her loveliest and create an awe 
about her as a guard angelic placed
                                
neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
                                
        
so much delights me as those graceful acts 
those thousand decencies that daily flow  
from all her words and actions mixed with love 
and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned   
union of mind or in us both one soul         
harmony to behold in wedded pair 
more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear 
i know my love by his way of walking  
and i know my love by his way of talking 
and i know my love dressed in a suit of blue   
and if my love leaves me what will i do 
  and still she cried i love him the best         
  and a troubled mind sure can know no rest 
  and still she cried bonny boys are few  
  and if my love leaves me what will i do 
there is a dance house in mardyke 
and there my true love goes every night          
he takes a strange one upon his knee  
and dont you think now that vexes me  
  and still she cried i love him the best 
  and a troubled mind sure can know no rest 
  and still she cried bonny boys are few          
  and if my love leaves me what will i do 
oh the days are gone when beauty bright 
        my hearts chain wove   
when my dream of life from morn till night 
        was love still love 
        new hope may bloom           
        and days may come  
    of milder calmer beam   
but theres nothing half so sweet in life 
    as loves young dream 
no theres nothing half so sweet in life         
    as loves young dream 
love is enough though the world be awaning   
and the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining   
  though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover 
the goldcups and daisies fair blooming thereunder   
though the hills be held shadows and the sea a dark wonder           
  and this day draw a veil over all deeds passd over   
yet their hands shall not tremble their feet shall not falter   
the void shall not weary the fear shall not alter 
  these lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover  
love is enough ho ye who seek saving         
  go no further come hither there have been who have found it  
and these know the house of fulfilment of craving 
  these know the cup with the roses around it  
  these know the worlds wound and the balm that hath bound it   
cry out the world heedeth not love lead us home         
he leadeth he hearkeneth he cometh to youward  
  set your faces as steel to the fears that assemble  
round his goad for the faint and his scourge for the froward 
  lo his lips how with tales of last kisses they tremble  
  lo his eyes of all sorrow that may not dissemble           
cry out for he heedeth o love lead us home   
now  what is love i pray thee tell 
it is that fountain and that well   
where pleasure and repentance dwell   
it is perhaps the sauncing bell    
that tolls all into heaven or hell         
and this is love as i hear tell   
yet what is love i prithee say   
it is a work on holiday   
it is december matched with may 
when lusty bloods in fresh array         
hear ten months after of the play  
and this is love as i hear say 
only to be twin elements of joy  
in this extravagance of being love   
were our divided natures shaped in twain 
and to this hour the whole world must consent  
is it not very marvellous our lives           
can only come to this out of a long 
strange sundering with the years of the world between us  
  shall life do more than god for hath not god 
striven with himself when into known delight   
his unaccomplisht joy he would put forth          
this mystery of a world sign of his striving   
else wherefore this a thing to break the mind  
with labouring in the wonder of it that here   
beingthe world and weis suffered to be   
but lying on thy breast one notable day        
sudden exceeding agony of love   
made my mind a trance of infinite knowledge 
i was not yet i saw the will of god   
as light unfashiond unendurable flame  
interminable not to be supposed          
and there was no more creature except light   
the dreadful burning of the lonely gods  
unutterd joy and then past telling came  
shuddering and division in the light  
therein like trembling was desire to know         
its own perfect beauty and it became  
a cloven fire a double flaming each  
adorable to each against itself 
waging a burning love which was the world 
a moment satisfied in that lovestrife        
i knew the worldand when i fell from there   
then knew i also what this life would do  
in being twinin being man and woman 
for it would do even as its endless master  
making the world had done yea with itself        
would strive and for the strife would into sex 
be cloven double burning made thereby   
desirable to itself contrivd joy  
is sex in life and by no other thing  
than by a perfect sundering could life          
change the dark stream of unappointed joy 
to perfect praise of itself the glee that loves   
and worships its own being this is ours 
yet only for that we have been so long 
sundered desire thence is our life all praise          
but we well knowing by our strength of joy  
there is no sundering more how far we love  
from those sad lives that know a halflove only   
alone thereby knowing themselves for ever 
sealed in division of love and therefore made         
to pour their strength always into their loves 
fierceness as green wood bleeds its hissing sap   
into red heat of a fire not so do we 
the cloven anger life hath left to wage 
its flame against itself here turned to one        
selfadorationah what comes of this   
the joy falters a moment with closed wings  
wearying in its upward journey ere 
again it goes on high bearing its song  
its delight breathing and its vigour beating        
the highest height of the air above the world  
  what hast thou done to mei would have soul 
before i knew thee love a captive held  
by flesh now inly delighted with desire   
my body knows itself to be nought else        
but thy hearts worship of me and my soul   
therein is sunlight held by warm gold air   
nay all my body is become a song   
upon the breath of spirit a lovesong   
  and mine is all like one rapt faculty         
as it were listening to the love in thee 
my whole mortality trembling to take   
thy body like heard singing of thy spirit   
  surely by this beloved we must know   
our love is perfect herethat not as holds         
the common dullard thought we are things lost  
in an amazement that is all unware 
but wonderfully knowing what we are   
lo now that body is the song whereof  
spirit is mood knoweth not our delight         
knoweth not beautifully now our love  
that life here to this festival bid come 
clad in his splendour of worldly day and night 
filled and empowerd by heavenly lust is all   
the glad imagination of the spirit        
  were it not so love could not be at all  
nought could be but a yearning to fulfil 
desire of beauty by vain reaching forth  
of sense to hold and understand the vision   
made by impassiond bodyvision of thee        
but music mixt with music are in love   
bodily senses and as flame hath light   
spirit this nature hath imagined round it   
no way concealed therein when love comes near 
nor in the perfect wedding of desires         
suffering any hindrance   
  ah but now 
now am i given loves eternal secret  
yea thou and i who speak are but the joy   
of our for ever mated spirits but now       
the wisdom of my gladness even through spirit   
looks divinely elate who hath for joy   
our spirits who hath imagined them 
round him in fashiond radiance of desire   
as into light of these exulting bodies       
flaming spirit is uttered 
all thoughts all passions all delights  
whatever stirs this mortal frame    
all are but ministers of love    
    and feed his sacred flame    
oft in my waking dreams do i           
live oer again that happy hour  
when midway on the mount i lay   
    beside the ruind tower   
the moonshine stealing oer the scene    
had blended with the lights of eve   
and she was there my hope my joy  
    my own dear genevieve  
she leand against the armd man    
the statue of the armd knight   
she stood and listend to my lay     
    amid the lingering light  
few sorrows hath she of her own  
my hope my joy my genevieve    
she loves me best wheneer i sing    
    the songs that make her grieve   
i playd a soft and doleful air  
i sang an old and moving story   
an old rude song that suited well   
    that ruin wild and hoary  
she listend with a flitting blush   
with downcast eyes and modest grace    
for well she knew i could not choose    
    but gaze upon her face    
i told her of the knight that wore   
upon his shield a burning brand   
and that for ten long years he wood    
    the lady of the land   
i told her how he pined and ah  
the deep the low the pleading tone    
with which i sang anothers love     
    interpreted my own  
she listend with a flitting blush  
with downcast eyes and modest grace   
and she forgave me that i gazed  
    too fondly on her face     
but when i told the cruel scorn   
that crazed that bold and lovely knight   
and that he crossd the mountainwoods    
    nor rested day nor night  
that sometimes from the savage den   
and sometimes from the darksome shade  
and sometimes starting up at once    
    in green and sunny glade  
there came and lookd him in the face   
an angel beautiful and bright     
and that he knew it was a fiend  
    this miserable knight  
and that unknowing what he did  
he leapd amid a murderous band  
and saved from outrage worse than death     
    the lady of the land  
and how she wept and claspd his knees    
and how she tended him in vain   
and ever strove to expiate  
    the scorn that crazed his brain    
and that she nursed him in a cave   
and how his madness went away    
when on the yellow forest leaves  
    a dying man he lay    
his dying wordsbut when i reachd    
that tenderest strain of all the ditty    
my faltering voice and pausing harp  
    disturbd her soul with pity    
all impulses of soul and sense    
had thrilld my guileless genevieve     
the music and the doleful tale   
    the rich and balmy eve    
 melibus
shepherd whats love i pray thee tell  
fau  it is that fountain and that well   
where pleasure and repentance dwell   
it is perhaps that sauncing bell 
  that tolls all into heaven or hell          
  and this is love as i heard tell 
meli  yet what is love i prithee say   
fau  it is a work on holiday   
it is december matched with may 
when lusty bloods in fresh array          
  hear ten months after of the play   
  and this is love as i hear say   
let it go on let the love of this hour be poured out till all the answers are made the last dollar spent and the last blood gone 
time runs with an ax and a hammer time slides down the hallways with a passkey and a masterkey and time gets by time wins  
let the love of this hour go on let all the oaths and children and people of this love be clean as a washed stone under a waterfall in the sun   
time is a young man with ballplayer legs time runs a winning race against life and the clocks time tickles with rust and spots   
let love go on the heartbeats are measured out with a measuring glass so many apiece to gamble with to use and spend and reckon let love go on           
from the desert i come to thee  
  on a stallion shod with fire  
and the winds are left behind 
  in the speed of my desire  
under thy window i stand          
  and the midnight hears my cry 
i love thee i love but thee 
  with a love that shall not die 
    till the sun grows cold  
    and the stars are old         
    and the leaves of the judgment  
        book unfold 
whoever loves if he do not propose 
the right true end of love hes one that goes  
to sea for nothing but to make him sick  
love is a bearwhelp born if we oerlick   
our love and force it new strange shapes  to take          
we err and of a lump a monster make  
were not a calf a monster that were grown   
faced like a man though better than his own   
perfection is in unity prefer   
one woman first and then one thing in her          
i when i value gold may think upon   
the ductileness the application   
the wholesomeness the ingenuity   
from rust from soil from fire ever free   
but if i love it tis because tis made          
by our new nature use the soul of trade   
  all this in women we might think upon  
if women had themand yet love but one  
can men more injure women than to say  
they love them for that by which theyre not they           
makes virtue woman must i cool my blood  
till i both be and find one wise and good  
may barren angels love so but if we   
make love to woman virtue is not she 
as beauty is not nor wealth  he that strays thus           
from her to hers is more adulterous 
than if he took her maid search every sphere   
and firmament our cupid is not there 
hes an infernal god and underground  
with pluto dwells where gold and fire abound          
men to such gods their sacrificing coals  
did not on altars lay but pits and holes   
although we see celestial bodies move  
above the earth the earth we till and love 
so we her airs contemplate words and heart         
and virtues but we love the centric part   
  nor is the soul more worthy or more fit   
for love than this as infinite as it   
but in attaining this desired place 
how much they err that set out at the face         
the hair a forest  is of ambushes 
of springes snares fetters and manacles  
the brow becalms us when tis smooth and plain 
and when tis wrinkled shipwrecks us again 
smooth tis a paradise where we would have         
immortal stay but wrinkled tis a grave 
the nose like to the first meridian  runs 
not twixt an east and west but twixt two suns  
it leaves a cheek a rosy hemisphere  
on either side and then directs us where         
upon the islands fortunate we fall 
not faint canaries but ambrosial  
her swelling lips to which when we are come  
we anchor there and think ourselves at home   
for they seem all there sirens songs and there           
wise delphic oracles do fill the ear  
there  in a creek where chosen pearls do swell  
the remora her cleaving tongue doth dwell 
these and the glorious promontory her chin 
oerpast and the straight hellespont  between         
the sestos and abydos of her breasts  
not of two lovers but two loves the nests 
succeeds a boundless sea but yet thine eye  
some island moles may scattered there descry   
and sailing towards her india in that way           
shall at her fair atlantic navel stay 
though there the current be the pilot made  
yet ere thou be where thou shouldst be embayd   
thou shalt upon another forest set 
where many shipwreck and no further get         
when thou art there consider what this chase   
misspent by thy beginning at the face 
  rather set out below practise thy art 
some symmetry the foot hath with that part   
which thou dost seek and is thy map for that          
lovely enough to stop but not stay at   
least subject to disguise and change it is  
men say the devil never can change his   
it is the emblem that hath figured  
firmness tis the first part that comes to bed           
civility we see refined the kiss  
which at the face began transplanted is 
since to the hand since to the imperial knee  
now at the papal foot delights to be  
if kings think that the nearer way and do           
rise from the foot lovers may do so too 
for as free spheres move faster far than can   
birds whom the air resists so may that man 
which goes this empty and ethereal way   
than if at beautys elements  he stay           
rich nature in women wisely made 
two purses and their mouths aversely laid  
they then which to the lower tribute owe   
that way which that exchequer looks must go 
he which doth not his error is as great         
as who by clyster gives the stomach meat 
love a child is ever crying   
please him and he straight is flying 
give him he the more is craving   
never satisfied with having  
his desires have no measure          
endless folly is his treasure   
what he promiseth he breaketh   
trust not one word that he speaketh   
he vows nothing but false matter   
and to cozen you will flatter           
let him gain the hand hell leave you 
and still glory to deceive you  
he will triumph in your wailing 
and yet cause be of your failing   
these his virtues are and slighter         
are his gifts his favours lighter 
feathers are as firm in staying 
wolves no fiercer in their preying 
as a child then leave him crying  
nor seek him so given to flying         
love in a hut with water and a crust 
islove forgive uscinders ashes dust   
love in a palace is perhaps at last 
more grievous torment than a hermits fast 
that is a doubtful tale from faery land          
hard for the nonelect to understand  
had lycius livd to hand his story down  
he might have given the moral a fresh frown 
or clenchd it quite but too short was their bliss   
to breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss          
besides there nightly with terrific glare   
love jealous grown of so complete a pair   
hoverd and buzzd his wings with fearful roar   
above the lintel of their chamber door   
and down the passage cast a glow upon the floor           
  for all this came a ruin side by side  
they were enthroned in the even tide 
upon a couch near to a curtaining  
whose airy texture from a golden string 
floated into the room and let appear          
unveild the summer heaven blue and clear  
betwixt two marble shaftsthere they reposed  
where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed  
saving a tythe which love still open kept   
that they might see each other while they almost slept          
when from the slope side of a suburb hill   
deafening the swallows twitter came a thrill  
of trumpetslycius startedthe sounds fled  
but left a thought a buzzing in his head   
for the first time since first he harbourd in         
that purplelined palace of sweet sin 
his spirit passd beyond its golden bourn 
into the noisy world almost forsworn  
the lady ever watchful penetrant 
saw this with pain so arguing a want          
of something more more than her empery   
of joys and she began to moan and sigh   
because he mused beyond her knowing well 
that but a moments thought is passions passing bell   
why do you sigh fair creature whisperd he         
why do you think returnd she tenderly   
you have deserted mewhere am i now 
not in your heart while care weighs on your brow 
no no you have dismissd me and i go  
from your breast houseless ay it must be so           
he answerd bending to her open eyes 
where he was mirrord small in paradise  
my silver planet both of eve and morn  
why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn 
while i am striving how to fill my heart         
with deeper crimson and a double smart 
how to entangle trammel up and snare 
your soul in mine and labyrinth you there  
like the hid scent in an unbudded rose  
ay a sweet kissyou see your mighty woes          
my thoughts shall i unveil them listen then 
what mortal hath a prize that other men 
may be confounded and abashd withal 
but lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical  
and triumph as in thee i should rejoice         
amid the hoarse alarm of corinths voice   
let my foes choke and my friends shout afar  
while through the thronged streets your bridal car   
wheels round its dazzling spokesthe ladys cheek  
trembled she nothing said but pale and meek         
arose and knelt before him wept a rain   
of sorrows at his words at last with pain   
beseeching him the while his hand she wrung   
to change his purpose he thereat was stung 
perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim          
her wild and timid nature to his aim  
besides for all his love in self despite  
against his better self he took delight  
luxurious in her sorrows soft and new   
his passion cruel grown took on a hue           
fierce and sanguineous as twas possible  
in one whose brow had no dark veins to swell   
fine was the mitigated fury like   
apollos presence when in act to strike   
the serpentha the serpent certes she          
was none she burnt she lovd the tyranny  
and all subdued consented to the hour   
when to the bridal he should lead his paramour 
whispering in midnight silence said the youth 
sure some sweet name thou hast though by my truth         
i have not askd it ever thinking thee  
not mortal but of heavenly progeny  
as still i do hast any mortal name  
fit appellation for this dazzling frame 
or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth         
to share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth   
i have no friends said lamia no not one  
my presence in wide corinth hardly known   
my parents bones are in their dusty urns   
sepulchred where no kindled incense burns         
seeing all their luckless race are dead save me 
and i neglect the holy rite for thee 
even as you list invite your many guests   
but if as now it seems your vision rests  
with any pleasure on me do not bid           
old apolloniusfrom him keep me hid 
lycius perplexd at words so blind and blank  
made close inquiry from whose touch she shrank   
feigning a sleep and he to the dull shade   
of deep sleep in a moment was betrayd           
  it was the custom then to bring away 
the bride from home at blushing shut of day 
veild in a chariot heralded along   
by strewn flowers torches and a marriage song   
with other pageants but this fair unknown           
had not a friend so being left alone 
lycius was gone to summon all his kin   
and knowing surely she could never win 
his foolish heart from its mad pompousness  
she set herself highthoughted how to dress           
the misery in fit magnificence  
she did so but tis doubtful how and whence 
came and who were her subtle servitors  
about the halls and to and from the doors  
there was a noise of wings till in short space         
the glowing banquetroom shone with widearched grace   
a haunting music sole perhaps and lone   
supportress of the faeryroof made moan  
throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade 
fresh carved cedar mimicking a glade          
of palm and plantain met from either side  
high in the midst in honour of the bride   
two palms and then two plantains and so on 
from either side their stems branchd one to one   
all down the aisled place and beneath all           
there ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall  
so canopied lay an untasted feast  
teeming with odours lamia regal drest  
silently paced about and as she went 
in pale contented sort of discontent          
missiond her viewless servants to enrich 
the fretted splendour of each nook and niche   
between the treestems marbled plain at first 
came jasper pannels then anon there burst 
forth creeping imagery of slighter trees         
and with the larger wove in small intricacies  
approving all she faded at selfwill 
and shut the chamber up close hushd and still  
complete and ready for the revels rude   
when dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude           
  the day appeard and all the gossip rout 
o senseless lycius madman wherefore flout  
the silentblessing fate warm cloisterd hours   
and show to common eyes these secret bowers 
the herd approachd each guest with busy brain          
arriving at the portal gazd amain   
and enterd marveling for they knew the street   
rememberd it from childhood all complete 
without a gap yet neer before had seen  
that royal porch that highbuilt fair demesne         
so in they hurried all mazd curious and keen   
save one who lookd thereon with eye severe   
and with calmplanted steps walkd in austere  
twas apollonius something too he laughd  
as though some knotty problem that had daft         
his patient thought had now begun to thaw  
and solve and melttwas just as he foresaw   
  he met within the murmurous vestibule   
his young disciple tis no common rule 
lycius said he for uninvited guest           
to force himself upon you and infest 
with an unbidden presence the bright throng 
of younger friends yet must i do this wrong  
and you forgive me lycius blushd and led   
the old man through the inner doors broadspread          
with reconciling words and courteous mien 
turning into sweet milk the sophists spleen   
  of wealthy lustre was the banquetroom 
filld with pervading brilliance and perfume   
before each lucid pannel fuming stood          
a censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood  
each by a sacred tripod held aloft 
whose slender feet wideswervd upon the soft   
woolwoofed carpets fifty wreaths of smoke  
from fifty censers their light voyage took           
to the high roof still mimickd as they rose   
along the mirrord walls by twinclouds odorous   
twelve sphered tables by silk seats insphered 
high as the level of a mans breast reard   
on libbards paws upheld the heavy gold          
of cups and goblets and the store thrice told  
of ceres horn and in huge vessels wine   
came from the gloomy tun with merry shine   
thus loaded with a feast the tables stood   
each shrining in the midst the image of a god          
  when in an antichamber every guest   
had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure pressd 
by ministring slaves upon his hands and feet 
and fragrant oils with ceremony meet   
pourd on his hair they all movd to the feast         
in white robes and themselves in order placed  
around the silken couches wondering   
whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring  
  soft went the music the soft air along 
while fluent greek a voweld undersong         
kept up among the guests discoursing low  
at first for scarcely was the wine at flow 
but when the happy vintage touchd their brains   
louder they talk and louder come the strains   
of powerful instrumentsthe gorgeous dyes          
the space the splendour of the draperies   
the roof of awful richness nectarous cheer 
beautiful slaves and lamias self appear  
now when the wine has done its rosy deed   
and every soul from human trammels freed         
no more so strange for merry wine sweet wine 
will make elysian shades not too fair too divine 
soon was god bacchus at meridian height  
flushd were their cheeks and bright eyes double bright   
garlands of every green and every scent          
from vales deflowerd or foresttrees branch rent   
in baskets of bright osierd gold were brought  
high as the handles heapd to suit the thought 
of every guest that each as he did please 
might fancyfit his brows silkpillowd at his ease         
  what wreath for lamia what for lycius 
what for the sage old apollonius  
upon her aching forehead be there hung 
the leaves of willow and of adders tongue  
and for the youth quick let us strip for him          
the thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim 
into forgetfulness and for the sage 
let speargrass and the spiteful thistle wage   
war on his temples do not all charms fly 
at the mere touch of cold philosophy          
there was an awful rainbow once in heaven   
we know her woof her texture she is given  
in the dull catalogue of common things   
philosophy will clip an angels wings 
conquer all mysteries by rule and line           
empty the haunted air and gnomed mine   
unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made 
the tenderpersond lamia melt into a shade 
  by her glad lycius sitting in chief place   
scarce saw in all the room another face          
till checking his love trance a cup he took   
full brimmd and opposite sent forth a look 
cross the broad table to beseech a glance  
from his old teachers wrinkled countenance 
and pledge him the baldhead philosopher         
had fixd his eye without a twinkle or stir 
full on the alarmed beauty of the bride  
browbeating her fair form and troubling her sweet pride  
lycius then pressd her hand with devout touch   
as pale it lay upon the rosy couch         
twas icy and the cold ran through his veins  
then sudden it grew hot and all the pains   
of an unnatural heat shot to his heart   
lamia what means this wherefore dost thou start   
knowst thou that man poor lamia answerd not          
he gazd into her eyes and not a jot  
ownd they the lovelorn piteous appeal   
more more he gazd his human senses reel  
some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs   
there was no recognition in those orbs           
lamia he criedand no softtoned reply   
the many heard and the loud revelry   
grew hush the stately music no more breathes  
the myrtle sickend in a thousand wreaths   
by faint degrees voice lute and pleasure ceased           
a deadly silence step by step increased  
until it seemd a horrid presence there  
and not a man but felt the terror in his hair  
lamia he shriekd and nothing but the shriek   
with its sad echo did the silence break          
begone foul dream he cried gazing again 
in the brides face where now no azure vein 
wanderd on fairspaced temples no soft bloom  
misted the cheek no passion to illume 
the deeprecessed visionall was blight         
lamia no longer fair there sat a deadly white   
shut shut those juggling eyes thou ruthless man   
turn them aside wretch or the righteous ban  
of all the gods whose dreadful images   
here represent their shadowy presences          
may pierce them on the sudden with the thorn   
of painful blindness leaving thee forlorn 
in trembling dotage to the feeblest fright  
of conscience for their long offended might  
for all thine impious proudheart sophistries         
unlawful magic and enticing lies 
corinthians look upon that graybeard wretch 
mark how possessd his lashless eyelids stretch 
around his demon eyes corinthians see 
my sweet bride withers at their potency           
fool said the sophist in an undertone   
gruff with contempt which a deathnighing moan 
from lycius answerd as heartstruck and lost 
he sank supine beside the aching ghost   
fool fool repeated he while his eyes still         
relented not nor movd from every ill  
of life have i preservd thee to this day  
and shall i see thee made a serpents prey 
then lamia breathd death breath the sophists eye  
like a sharp spear went through her utterly           
keen cruel perceant stinging she as well   
as her weak hand could any meaning tell  
motiond him to be silent vainly so  
he lookd and lookd again a levelno 
a serpent echoed he no sooner said           
than with a frightful scream she vanished   
and lycius arms were empty of delight   
as were his limbs of life from that same night   
on the high couch he layhis friends came round  
supported himno pulse or breath they found           
and in its marriage robe the heavy body wound
a pity beyond all telling  
is hid in the heart of love  
the folk who are buying and selling   
the clouds on their journey above  
the cold wet winds ever blowing           
and the shadowy hazel grove   
where mousegrey waters are flowing 
threaten the head that i love   
strong son of god immortal love   
  whom we that have not seen thy face   
  by faith and faith alone embrace  
believing where we cannot prove 
thine are these orbs of light and shade          
  thou madest life in man and brute   
  thou madest death and lo thy foot  
is on the skull which thou hast made  
thou wilt not leave us in the dust 
  thou madest man he knows not why           
  he thinks he was not made to die 
and thou hast made him thou art just 
thou seemest human and divine   
  the highest holiest manhood thou  
  our wills are ours we know not how         
our wills are ours to make them thine   
our little systems have their day  
  they have their day and cease to be 
  they are but broken lights of thee  
and thou o lord art more than they          
we have but faith we cannot know  
  for knowledge is of things we see   
  and yet we trust it comes from thee 
a beam in darkness let it grow 
i want to die while you love me 
  while yet you hold me fair 
while laughter lies upon my lips 
  and lights are in my hair  
i want to die while you love me         
  and bear to that still bed 
your kisses turbulent unspent   
  to warm me when im dead   
i want to die while you love me  
  oh who would care to live          
till love has nothing more to ask   
  and nothing more to give   
i want to die while you love me  
  and never never see  
the glory of this perfect day         
  grow dim or cease to be 
over the mountains    
  and over the waves    
under the fountains   
  and under the graves  
under floods that are deepest            
  which neptune obey    
over rocks that are steepest  
  love will find out the way  
when there is no place   
  for the glowworm to lie     
when there is no space   
  for receipt of a fly  
when the midge dares not venture  
  lest herself fast she lay   
if love come he will enter     
  and will find out the way   
you may esteem him    
  a child for his might    
or you may deem him   
  a coward for his flight   
but if she whom love doth honour  
  be conceald from the day   
set a thousand guards upon her   
  love will find out the way  
some think to lose him    
  by having him confined   
and some do suppose him    
  poor heart to be blind  
but if neer so close ye wall him   
  do the best that ye may   
blind love if so ye call him    
  he will find out his way    
you may train the eagle  
  to stoop to your fist    
or you may inveigle    
  the phoenix of the east  
the lioness you may move her  
  to give over her prey    
but youll neer stop a lover    
  he will find out the way     
if the earth it should part him  
  he would gallop it oer  
if the seas should oerthwart him   
  he would swim to the shore  
should his love become a swallow     
  through the air to stray    
love will lend wings to follow   
  and will find out the way   
there is no striving  
  to cross his intent    
there is no contriving   
  his plots to prevent  
but if once the message greet him    
  that his true love doth stay   
if death should come and meet him    
  love will find out the way  
what word is that that changeth not  
though it be turnd and made in twain 
it is mine anna god it wot  
the only causer of my pain   
my love that meedeth with disdain          
  yet is it loved what will you more 
  it is my salve and eke my sore  
i love my life but not too well 
  to give it to thee like a flower 
so it may pleasure thee to dwell 
  deep in its perfume but an hour  
i love my life but not too well           
i love my life but not too well 
  to sing it note by note away  
so to thy soul the song may tell 
  the beauty of the desolate day   
i love my life but not too well           
i love my life but not too well  
  to cast it like a cloak on thine 
against the storms that sound and swell   
  between thy lonely heart and mine   
i love my life but not too well           
phbus  arise  
and paint the sable skies  
with azure white and red   
rouse memnons mother  from her tithons bed  
that she thy carriere  may with roses spread          
the nightingales thy coming eachwhere sing 
make an eternal spring 
give life to this dark world which lieth dead  
spread forth thy golden hair  
in larger locks than thou wast wont before          
and emperorlike decore 
with diadem of pearl thy temples fair 
chase hence the ugly night 
which serves but to make dear thy glorious light  
this is that happy morn          
that day longwishd day  
of all my life so dark 
if cruel stars have not my ruin sworn 
and fates not hope betray   
which only white deserves           
a diamond for ever should it mark  
this is the morn should bring unto this grove   
my love to hear and recompense my love  
fair king who all preserves 
but show thy blushing beams          
and thou two sweeter eyes  
shalt see than those which by penus streams  
did once thy heart surprise  
nay suns which shine as clear  
as thou when two thou did to rome appear           
now flora deck thyself in fairest guise   
if that ye winds would hear 
a voice surpassing far amphions lyre 
your stormy chiding stay  
let zephyr only breathe           
and with her tresses play 
kissing sometimes these purple ports of death    
the winds all silent are 
and phbus in his chair 
ensaffroning sea and air           
makes vanish every star   
night like a drunkard reels  
beyond the hills to shun his flaming wheels   
the fields with flowers are deckd in every hue   
the clouds with orient gold spangle their blue           
here is the pleasant place   
and everything save her who all should grace 
o love how thou art tired out with rhyme   
thou art a tree whereon all poets clime  
and from thy branches every one takes some   
of thy sweet fruit which fancy feeds upon  
but now thy tree is left so bare and poor           
that they can scarcely gather one plumb more   
when our glowing dreams were dead  
ruined our heroic piles   
something in your dark eyes said   
think no more of love or smiles  
something in me still would say         
though our dreamland palace goes  
i have seen how in decay   
still the wild rose clings and blows 
but your dark eyes willed it thus  
build our lofty dream again         
let our palace rise oer us  
love can never be till then 
  since love is such as that ye wot 
cannot always be wisely used 
i say therefore then blame me not  
though i therein have been abused  
for as with cause i am accused          
guilty i grant such was my lot  
and though it cannot be excused 
yet let such folly be forgot 
  for in my years of reckless youth 
methought the power of love so great          
that to his laws i bound my truth  
and to my will there was no let 
me list no more so far to fet   
such fruit lo as of love ensuth 
the gain was small that was to get         
and of the loss the less the ruth  
  and few there is but first or last  
a time in love once shall they have   
and glad i am my time is past   
henceforth my freedom to withsave          
now in my heart there shall i grave 
the granted grace that now i taste 
thanked be fortune that me gave  
so fair a gift so sure and fast   
  now such as have me seen ere this           
when youth in me set forth his kind   
and folly framed my thought amiss  
the fault whereof now well i find  
lo since that so it is assignd   
that unto each a time there is          
then blame the lot that led my mind   
some time to live in loves bliss  
  but from henceforth i do protest 
by proof of that that i have past  
shall never cease within my breast          
the power of love so late outcast  
the knot thereof is knit full fast 
and i thereto so sure professd  
for evermore with me to last  
the power wherein i am possessd           
i saw a vision yesternight 
enough to sate a seekers  sight  
i wished myself a shaker  there   
and her quick pants my trembling sphere  
it was a she so glittering bright          
youd think her soul an adamite   
a person of so rare a frame  
her body might be lined with the same 
beautys chiefest maid of honour   
you may break lent with looking on her           
  not the fair abbess of the skies    
  with all her nunnery of eyes   
  can show me such a glorious prize   
and yet because tis more renown 
to make a shadow shine shes brown          
a brown for which heaven would disband 
the galaxy and stars be tanned  
brown by reflection as her eye   
dazzles the summers livery 
old dormant windows must confess         
her beams their glimmering spectacles 
struck with the splendour of her face  
do the office of a burning glass   
  now where such radiant lights have shown   
  no wonder if her cheeks be grown          
  sunburned with lustre of her own   
my sight took pay but thank my charms  
i now impale her in mine arms  
loves compasses confining you 
good angels to a circle too           
is not the universe straightlaced  
when i can clasp it in the waist   
my amorous folds about thee hurled  
with drake i girdle in the world   
i hoop the firmament and make           
this my embrace the zodiac 
  how could thy center take my sense   
  when admiration doth commence  
  at the extreme circumference  
now to the melting kiss that sips           
the jellied philtre of her lips 
so sweet there is no tongue can praiset  
till transubstantiate with a taste 
inspired like mahomet from above 
by the billing of my heavenly dove          
love prints his signets in her smacks 
those ruddy drops of squeezing wax 
which wheresoever she imparts  
theyve privy seals to take up hearts 
  our mouths encountering at the sport         
  my slippery soul had quit the fort   
  but that she stopped the sallyport 
next to these sweets her lips dispence   
as twin conserves of eloquence   
the sweet perfume of her breath affords          
incorporating with her words 
no rosary this votress needs   
her very syllables are beads 
no sooner twixt those rubies born 
but jewels are in earrings worn           
with that delight her speech doth enter  
it is a kiss of the second venter    
  and i dissolve at what i hear  
  as if another rosamond were 
  couched in the labyrinth of my ear          
when i have seen by times fell hand defaced 
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age   
when sometimelofty towers i see downrazed 
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage   
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain         
advantage on the kingdom of the shore 
and the firm soil win of the watery main 
increasing store with loss and loss with store 
when i have seen such interchange of state  
or state itself confounded to decay          
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate  
that time will come and take my love away   
  this thought is as a death which cannot choose  
  but weep to have that which it fears to lose 
fastanchord eternal o love o woman i love  
o bride o wife more resistless than i can tell the thought of you    
then separate as disembodied or another born    
ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation

he who knows lovebecomes love and his eyes 
  behold love in the heart of everyone   
  even the loveless as the light of the sun 
is one with all it touches he is wise 
with undivided wisdom for he lies          
  in wisdoms arms his wanderings are done 
  for he has found the source whence all things run  
the guerdon of the quest that satisfies 
 love  guards the roses of thy lips   
  and flies about them like a bee  
if i approach he forward skips  
  and if i kiss he stingeth me  
i walk alone and cry out under the stars 
as one in a desert i hunger for refreshment 
i have need of the coolness of some azure pool 
o i would anoint my bosom with the clear water   
o i would immerse myself in the emulous depths           
o i would drink of ineffable dreams  
you beloved are the silvery lake shimmering in the desert of my youth   
you only can allay the fever of my spirit   
on your lips i should drain the fountain of life  
on your white breast i shall breath the perfume of numberless lilies           
therein i shall die a thousand deaths and arise reborn in the awful splendor of your love
                                
lay your handssofter than doves wingsin my hands so i may feel your young life flowing into mine thro your fingertips 
lay your eyes upon my eyes that i may grow tremulous beneath the flutter of your eyelids 
lay your heart against my heart that i may hear your love summoning me to forgetfulness  
lay your tresses about me that i may feel their warm sun streaming thro my veins          
lay your mouth on my mouth until all dissolves in mist about me 
                is it life is it death
                                
you are as a million birds that sing unto my heart o beloved   
thro the long nights i hear the chanting of blithe voices 
what divine minstrelsy what ravishment         
is this multitudinous melody the rapture of your kiss   
come to me press upon my brow the coolness of your young lips that i may hear the thunder of your love in the night
                                
when will it end the long vigil  
what dawn will bring you forever unto me o my beloved 
life is but shadow          
only you my beloved are more real than shadow   
beneath your caresses i am as one awakened unto life 
your fingertips bear presage of divinity your heartbeats are a threnody sublime 
o beloved you are as a white nenuphar lifting its snowy breast on a stream in your bosom are all the treasures of elysium the scent of your skin is like jasmine and honeysuckle  
why is such loveliness withheld from me o beloved          
when can i look upon you and say beloved all this beauty is mine forever 
when will it end the long vigil
                                
o miracle of love  
you whom i adore unto delirium  
your arms are white lilies upon my bosom         
stars encircle me when your lips lean down to mine there is the sound of many waters falling there is the murmur of a million nightingalesand the flash of brilliant lightning 
caress celestial 
moonpath of my dreams 
o miracle of lovemy divinity and my crucifixion
                                
when the young moon silvers the sky the earth is ours          
we shall go into the forest and wander in the shadow of the pines   
i shall cover you with leaves and we shall lie on the soft moss entwined like sisters   
and all the while i will know that the fragrance of your skin is sweeter to me than the perfumes of a million roses
                                
let me enfold you in my hair 
let me wind you as in a golden skein          
give me the curve of your throat milky white and rose that i may place about it the glossy fillets of my hair  
don it as a shining mantilla   
let my hair shower about you until you are radiant with perfume  
let it ripple over you like the wind on summer wheat 
then give me your lips that we may stand united beneath the downpour of its sunlight          
let us be intermingled as two trees that have bent one single root
                                
it rains beloved  
the dripping of the rain is like the cool kisses of your mouth  
i faint beneath the rapture of your lips 
be no longer tender         
cover me with frenzied kisseseven as i would drench my body in the cruel torrents of the rain   
envelop me from throat to ankle in delirium intolerable   
                                
to love you like the midnight storm   
to take you swooning unto death as the wind sweeps the waves in tempest           
to transport you unto delirium  
to hear the wild beating of your veins to feel flame shuddering your blood and to agonize you with my ardor  
to crush you as a flower upon my breast  
to bear you away to some secret valley where i would love you unto insensibility
                                
if i think of you i quiver from head to foot          
if i think of you tears flood my eyes 
if i pass you my heart quickens to suffocation and the blood seems to leave my body   
if i look into your eyes a sudden fire burns in my veins   
if i touch you i am as one possessed with madness my arms tremble and my limbs totter beneath me 
to love you is to suffer the pangs of an intolerable agony
                                
        
part first
my dear and only love i pray   
  this noble world of thee 
be governed by no other sway  
  but purest monarchie 
for if confusion have a part         
  which virtuous souls abhore   
and hold a synod in thy heart   
  i ll never love thee more 
like alexander i will reign  
  and i will reign alone          
my thoughts shall evermore disdain  
  a rival on my throne 
he either fears his fate too much  
  or his deserts are small   
that puts it not unto the touch         
  to win or lose it all   
but i must rule and govern still 
  and always give the law 
and have each subject at my will   
  and all to stand in awe         
but gainst my battery if i find 
  thou shunst the prize so sore 
as that thou setst me up a blind  
  i ll never love thee more 
if in the empire of thy heart           
  where i should solely be   
another do pretend a part 
  and dares to vie with me   
or if committees thou erect  
  and go on such a score          
i ll sing and laugh at thy neglect   
  and never love thee more   
but if thou wilt be constant then  
  and faithful of thy word   
i ll make thee glorious by my pen         
  and famous by my sword  
i ll serve thee in such noble ways 
  was never heard before  
i ll crown and deck thee all with bays  
  and love thee ever more         
part second
my dear and only love take heed   
  lest thou thyself expose   
and let all longing lovers feed  
  upon such looks as those   
a marble wall then build about          
  beset without a door 
but if thou let thy heart fly out  
  i ll never love thee more 
let not their oaths like volleys shot   
  make any breach at all          
nor smoothness of their language plot  
  which way to scale the wall   
nor balls of wildfire love consume 
  the shrine which i adore   
for if such smoke about thee fume          
  i ll never love thee more 
i think thy virtues be too strong   
  to suffer by surprise   
those victualled by my love so long   
  the siege at length must rise         
and leave thee ruld in that health 
  and state thou wast before 
but if thou turn a commonwealth 
  i ll never love thee more 
or if by fraud or by consent           
  thy heart to ruine come 
i ll sound no trumpet as i wont   
  nor march by tuck of drum  
but hold my arms like ensigns up 
  thy falsehood to deplore           
and bitterly will sigh and weep 
  and never love thee more   
i ll do with thee as nero did   
  when rome was set on fire  
not only all relief forbid           
  but to a hill retire 
and scorn to shed a tear to see  
  thy spirit grown so poor   
but smiling sing until i die   
  i ll never love thee more         
yet for the love i bare thee once 
  lest that thy name should die 
a monument of marblestone 
  the truth shall testifie   
that every pilgrim passing by         
  may pity and deplore  
my case and read the reason why 
  i can love thee no more 
the golden laws of love shall be 
  upon this pillar hung          
a simple heart a single eye 
  a true and constant tongue 
let no man for more love pretend 
  than he has hearts in store   
true love begun shall never end         
  love one and love no more  
then shall thy heart be set by mine   
  but in far different case  
for mine was true so was not thine   
  but lookt like janus face         
for as the waves with every wind   
  so sailst thou every shore   
and leavst my constant heart behind 
  how can i love thee more   
my heart shall with the sun be fixed           
  for constancy most strange 
and thine shall with the moon be mixed   
  delighting ay in change 
thy beauty shined at first more bright   
  and woe is me therefore         
that ever i found thy love so light 
  i could love thee no more  
the misty mountains smoking lakes 
  the rocks resounding echo 
the whistling wind that murmur makes          
  shall with me sing hey ho  
the tossing seas the tumbling boats  
  tears dropping from each shore   
shall tune with me their turtle notes 
  i ll never love thee more         
as doth the turtle chaste and true   
  her fellows death regrete 
and daily mourns for his adieu  
  and neer renews her mate  
so though thy faith was never fast           
  which grieves me wondrous sore   
yet i shall live in love so chaste 
  that i shall love no more  
and when all gallants ride about 
  these monuments to view         
whereon is written in and out  
  thou traitorous and untrue 
then in a passion they shall pause 
  and thus say sighing sore 
alas he had too just a cause           
  never to love thee more   
and when that tracing goddess fame  
  from east to west shall flee  
she shall record it to thy shame  
  how thou hast lovd me          
and how in odds our love was such   
  as few have been before 
thou loved too many and i too much   
  so i can love no more   
love thou thy land with love farbrought 
  from out the storied past and used  
  within the present but transfused   
thro future time by power of thought 
true love turnd round on fixed poles         
  love that endures not sordid ends  
  for english natures freemen friends  
thy brothers and immortal souls   
but pamper not a hasty time  
  nor feed with crude imaginings         
  the herd wild hearts and feeble wings  
that every sophister can lime   
deliver not the tasks of might   
  to weakness neither hide the ray 
  from those not blind who wait for day           
tho sitting girt with doubtful light 
make knowledge circle with the winds  
  but let her herald reverence fly   
  before her to whatever sky  
bear seed of men and growth of minds          
watch what maincurrents draw the years  
  cut prejudice against the grain  
  but gentle words are always gain 
regard the weakness of thy peers   
nor toil for title place or touch         
  of pension neither count on praise  
  it grows to guerdon afterdays   
nor deal in watchwords overmuch   
not clinging to some ancient saw   
  not masterd by some modern term         
  not swift nor slow to change but firm 
and in its season bring the law 
that from discussions lip may fall 
  with life that working strongly binds   
  set in all lights by many minds          
to close the interests of all   
for nature also cold and warm  
  and moist and dry devising long 
  thro many agents making strong  
matures the individual form          
meet is it changes should control   
  our being lest we rust in ease  
  we all are changed by still degrees 
all but the basis of the soul   
so let the change which comes be free          
  to ingroove itself with that which flies  
  and work a joint of state that plies  
its office moved with sympathy 
a saying hard to shape in act   
  for all the past of time reveals          
  a bridal dawn of thunderpeals   
wherever thought hath wedded fact  
even now we hear with inward strife 
  a motion toiling in the gloom 
  the spirit of the years to come           
yearning to mix himself with life  
a slowdevelopd strength awaits 
  completion in a painful school   
  phantoms of other forms of rule  
new majesties of mighty states          
the warders of the growing hour 
  but vague in vapor hard to mark 
  and round them sea and air are dark  
with great contrivances of power   
of many changes aptly joind           
  is bodied forth the second whole 
  regard gradation lest the soul   
of discord race the rising wind 
a wind to puff your idolfires  
  and heap their ashes on the head         
  to shame the boast so often made 
that we are wiser than our sires   
o yet if natures evil star 
  drive men in manhood as in youth   
  to follow flying steps of truth           
across the brazen bridge of war 
if new and old disastrous feud 
  must ever shock like armed foes 
  and this be true till time shall close 
that principles are raind in blood           
not yet the wise of heart would cease  
  to hold his hope thro shame and guilt 
  but with his hand against the hilt  
would pace the troubled land like peace 
not less tho dogs of faction bay         
  would serve his kind in deed and word  
  certain if knowledge bring the sword  
that knowledge takes the sword away   
would love the gleams of love that broke  
  from either side nor veil his eyes         
  and if some dreadful need should rise   
would strike and firmly and one stroke 
tomorrow yet would reap today 
  as we bear blossom of the dead   
  earn well the thrifty months nor wed           
raw haste halfsister to delay
i see you coming toward me  
what have i to say to you  
when we shall meet  
yet  
i lie here thinking of you   
  the stain of love          
is upon the world   
yellow yellow yellow 
it eats into the leaves   
smears with saffron  
the horned branches that lean         
heavily  
against a smooth purple sky  
  there is no light 
only a honeythick stain   
that drips from leaf to leaf          
and limb to limb 
spoiling the colors  
of the whole world  
  i am alone  
the weight of love           
has buoyed me up  
till my head   
knocks against the sky 
  see me   
my hair is dripping with nectar         
starlings carry it   
on their black wings   
see at last   
my arms and my hands 
are lying idle           
  how can i tell  
if i shall ever love you again   
she casts a spell oh casts a spell  
which haunts me more than i can tell  
dearer because she makes me ill 
than who would will to make me well   
she is my store oh she my store          
whose grey eye wounded me so sore  
who will not place in mine her palm   
nor love nor calm me any more  
she is my pet oh she my pet   
whom i can never more forget         
who would not lose by me one moan  
nor stone upon my cairn would set  
she is my roon oh she my roon 
who tells me nothing leaves me soon  
who would not lose by me one sigh          
were death and i within one room   
she is my dear oh she my dear 
who cares not whether i be here 
who will not weep when i am dead   
but makes me shed the silent tear          
hard my case oh hard my case  
for in her eye no hope i trace  
she will not hear me any more   
but i adore her silent face  
she is my choice oh she my choice           
who never made me to rejoice 
who caused my heart to ache so oft 
who put no softness in her voice   
great my grief oh great my grief 
neglected scorned beyond belief           
by her who looks at me askance  
by her who grants me no relief  
shes my desier oh my desire  
more glorious than the bright suns fire 
who were than wildblown ice more cold         
were i so bold as to sit by her 
she it is who stole my heart 
and left a void and aching smart   
but if she soften not her eye   
i know that life and i must part
jesus why dost thou love me so 
  what hast thou seen in me   
to make my happiness so great   
  so dear a joy to thee   
wert thou not god i then might think          
  thou hadst no eye to read   
the badness of that selfish heart  
  for which thine own did bleed 
but thou art god and knowest all  
  dear lord thou knowest me         
and yet thy knowledge hinders not   
  thy loves sweet liberty   
ah how thy grace hath wooed my soul   
  with persevering wiles  
now give me tears to weep for tears           
  are deeper joy than smiles 
each proof renewed of thy great love   
  humbles me more and more   
and brings to light forgotten sins 
  and lays them at my door           
the more i love thee lord the more   
  i hate my own cold heart   
the more thou woundest me with love   
  the more i feel the smart  
what shall i do then dearest lord           
  say shall i fly from thee 
and hide my poor unloving self   
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair 
thou hast doves eyes within thy locks   
thy hair is as a flock of goats 
that appear from mount gilead   
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn         
which came up from the washing  
whereof every one bear twins 
and none is barren among them   
thy lips are like a thread of scarlet 
and thy speech is comely          
thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate  
within thy locks 
thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armory  
whereon there hang a thousand bucklers   
all shields of mighty men         
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins  
which feed among the lilies  
until the day break and the shadows flee away 
i will get me to the mountain of myrrh   
and to the hill of frankincense         
thou art all fair my love   
there is no spot in thee  
come with me from lebanon my spouse  
with me from lebanon   
look from the top of amana           
from the top of shenir and hermon  
from the lions dens   
from the mountains of the leopards 
thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse 
thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes           
with one chain of thy neck   
how fair is thy love my sister my spouse  
how much better is thy love than wine 
and the smell of thine ointments than all spices  
thy lips o my spouse drop as the honeycomb           
honey and milk are under thy tongue   
and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon 
a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse   
a spring shut up a fountain sealed   
thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits          
camphire with spikenard  
spikenard and saffron  
calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense 
myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices  
a fountain of gardens          
a well of living waters   
and streams from lebanon  
awake o north wind and come thou south   
blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out  
let my beloved come into his garden           
and eat his pleasant fruits
i love my life but not too well 
  to give it to thee like a flower 
so it may pleasure thee to dwell 
  deep in its perfume but an hour  
i love my life but not too well           
i love my life but not too well 
  to sing it note by note away  
so to thy soul the song may tell 
  the beauty of the desolate day   
i love my life but not too well           
i love my life but not too well 
  to cast it like a cloak on thine 
against the storms that sound and swell   
  between thy lonely heart and mine   
i love my life but not too well           
your love is like a blue blue wave  
  the little rainbows play in   
your love is like a mountain cave   
  cool shadows darkly stay in   
it thrills me like great gales at war         
  it soothes like softest singing  
it bears me where clear rivers are 
  with reeds and rushes swinging   
or out to pearly shores afar  
  where temple bells are ringing           
love fortune and my mind which do remember 
eke that is now and that that once hath ben  
torment my heart so sore that very often 
i hate and envy them beyond all measure  
love slayeth mine heart while fortune is depriver         
of all my comfort the foolish mind then  
burneth and plaineth as one that very seldome  
liveth in rest so still in displeasure   
my pleasant days they fleet and pass  
and daily doth mine ill change to the worse         
while more than half is run now of my course   
alas not of steel but of brittle glass 
  i see that from my hand falleth my trust  
  and all my thoughts are dashed into dust  
 could love for ever 
          run like a river   
          and times endeavour   
            be tried in vain 
          no other pleasure           
          with this could measure  
          and like a treasure 
            wed hug the chain  
          but since our sighing  
          ends not in dying          
          and formd for flying   
            love plumes his wing   
          then for this reason   
          lets love a season   
but let that season be only spring         
          when lovers parted  
          feel brokenhearted   
          and all hopes thwarted  
            expect to die 
          a few years older          
          ah how much colder 
          they might behold her  
            for whom they sigh  
          when linkd together  
          in every weather           
          they pluck loves feather 
            from out his wing   
          hell stay for ever   
          but sadly shiver 
without his plumage when past the spring           
          like chiefs of faction   
          his life is action 
          a formal paction 
            that curbs his reign   
          obscures his glory         
          despot no more he  
          such territory   
            quits with disdain  
          still still advancing   
          with banners glancing         
          his power enhancing   
            he must move on  
          repose but cloys him  
          retreat destroys him  
love brooks not a degraded throne          
          wait not fond lover  
          till years are over   
          and then recover   
            as from a dream  
          while each bewailing           
          the others failing   
          with wrath and railing   
            all hideous seem 
          while first decreasing   
          yet not quite ceasing         
          wait not till teasing  
            all passion blight  
          if once diminishd  
          love reign is finishd   
then part in friendshipand bid goodnight         
          so shall affection  
          to recollection  
          the dear connection 
            bring back with joy 
          you had not waited          
          till tired or hated  
          your passions sated 
            began to coy  
          your last embraces  
          leave no cold traces          
          the same fond faces   
            as through the past 
          and eyes the mirrors  
          of your sweet errors  
reflect but rapturenot least though last           
  o fairest of creation last and best 
of all gods works creature in whom excelled   
whatever can to sight or thought be formed  
holy divine good amiable or sweet 
how art thou lost how on a sudden lost          
defaced deflowered and now to death devote   
rather how hast thou yielded to transgress  
the strict forbiddance how to violate 
the sacred fruit forbidden some cursd fraud   
of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown         
and me with thee hath ruined for with thee  
certain my resolution is to die 
how can i live without thee how forego   
thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined  
to live again in these wild woods forlorn           
should god create another eve and i   
another rib afford yet loss of thee   
would never from my heart no no i feel 
the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh  
bone of my bone thou art and from thy state         
mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
                                
however i with thee have fixed my lot   
certain to undergo like doom if death 
consort with thee death is to me as life   
so forcible within my heart i feel          
the bond of nature draw me to my own  
my own in thee for what thou art is mine   
our state cannot be severed we are one  
one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself 
          true separations   
          ask more than patience

consider what you first did swear unto          
to fast to study and to see no woman   
flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth 
say can you fast your stomachs are too young 
and abstinence engenders maladies  
and where that you have vowed to study lords          
in that each of you have forsworn his book  
can you still dream and pore and thereon look  
for when would you my lordor youor you   
have found the ground of studys excellence  
without the beauty of a womans face          
from womens eyes this doctrine i derive 
they are the ground the books the academes   
from whence doth spring the true promethean fire  
why universal plodding poisons up  
the nimble spirits in the arteries         
as motion and longduring action tires 
the sinewy vigor of the traveller  
now for not looking on a womans face   
you have in that forsworn the use of eyes   
and study too the causer of your vow         
for where is any author in the world   
teaches such beauty as a womans eye  
learning is but an adjunct to ourself 
and where we are our learning likewise is   
then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes          
do we not likewise see our learning there   
o we have made a vow to study lords 
and in that vow we have forsworn our books  
for when would you my liegeor youor you  
in leaden contemplation have found out         
such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes  
of beautys tutors have enriched you with   
other slow arts entirely keep the brain  
and therefore finding barren practisers 
scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil           
but love first learned in a ladys eyes 
lives not alone immured in the brain  
but with the motion of all elements  
courses as swift as thought in every power  
and gives to every power a double power          
above their functions and their offices  
it adds a precious seeing to the eye  
a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind  
a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound 
when the suspicious head of theft is stopped           
loves feeling is more soft and sensible  
than are the tender horns of cockled snails 
loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste   
for valor is not love a hercules  
still climbing trees in the hesperides           
subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical 
as bright apollos lute strung with his hair  
and when love speaks the voice of all the gods 
make heaven drowsy with the harmony   
never durst poet touch a pen to write          
until his ink were tempered with loves sighs  
o then his lines would ravish savage ears   
and plant in tyrants mild humility 
from womens eyes this doctrine i derive 
they sparkle still the right promethean fire           
they are the books the arts the academes  
that show contain and nourish all the world  
else none at all in aught proves excellent  
then fools you were these women to forswear 
or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools         
for wisdoms sake a word that all men love 
or for loves sake a word that loves all men  
or for mens sake the authors of these women  
or womens sake by whom we men are men  
let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves           
or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths 
it is religion to be thus forsworn 
for charity itself fulfils the law   
and who can sever love from charity   

love  will teach us all things but we must learn how to win love it is got with difficulty it is a possession dearly bought with much labour and in long time for one must love not sometimes only for a passing moment but always there is no man who doth not sometimes love even the wicked can do that   
  and let not mens sin dishearten thee love a man even in his sin for that love is a likeness of the divine love and is the summit of love on earth love all gods creation both the whole and every grain of sand love every leaf every ray of light love the animals love the plants love each separate thing if thou love each thing thou wilt perceive the mystery of god in all and when once thou perceive this thou wilt thenceforward grow every day to a fuller understanding of it until thou come at last to love the whole world with a love that will then be allembracing and universal
the ring and the book
o lyric love halfangel and halfbird 
and all a wonder and a wild desire   
boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun  
took sanctuary within the holier blue 
and sang a kindred soul out to his face         
yet human at the redripe of the heart   
when the first summons from the darkling earth  
reachd thee amid thy chambers blanchd their blue  
and bared them of the gloryto drop down 
to toil for man to suffer or to die         
this is the same voice can thy soul know change  
hail then and hearken from the realms of help 
never may i commence my song my due   
to god who best taught song by gift of thee 
except with bent head and beseeching hand           
that still despite the distance and the dark  
what was again may be some interchange  
of grace some splendour once thy very thought 
some benediction anciently thy smile  
never conclude but raising hand and head           
thither where eyes that cannot reach yet yearn   
for all hope all sustainment all reward   
their utmost up and onso blessing back  
in those thy realms of help that heaven thy home 
some whiteness which i judge thy face makes proud          
some wanness where i think thy foot may fall
never  seek to tell thy love   
love that never told can be  
for the gentle wind does move 
silently invisibly 
i told my love i told my love          
i told her all my heart   
trembling cold in ghastly fears  
ah she doth depart 
soon as she was gone from me 
a traveller came by         
silently invisibly 
he took her with a sigh
          what desperations   
            from such have risen   
          but yet remaining          
          what ist but chaining 
          hearts which once waning   
            beat gainst their prison 
          time can but cloy love   
          and use destroy love          
          the wingd boy love  
            is but for boys  
          youll find it torture 
          though sharper shorter  
to wean and not wear out your joys
and is it pain to you   
  that we must love and part 
ah if you only knew 
  the gladness in my heart   
love is enough each day           
  i look upon the sun  
he loves me i shall say  
  now is my life begun 
he loves me every night  
  on the dark verge of sleep          
the rapture will alight 
  and to my bosom creep   
peace for i should not dare  
  a keener joy implore 
my soul shall feel no care           
  until you love no more
for aught that ever i could read   
could ever hear by tale or history 
the course of true love never did run smooth   
but either it was different in blood 
or else misgraffd in respect of years           
or else it stood upon the choice of friends 
or if there were a sympathy in choice   
war death or sickness did lay siege to it 
making it momentary as a sound  
swift as a shadow short as any dream         
brief as the lightning in the collied night 
that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth  
and ere a man hath power to saybehold  
the jaws of darkness do devour it up  
so quick bright things come to confusion
children born of fairy stock  
never need for shirt or frock   
never want for food or fire  
always get their hearts desire 
jingle pockets full of gold          
marry when theyre seven years old 
every fairy child may keep 
two strong ponies and ten sheep 
all have houses each his own   
built of brick or granite stone         
they live on cherries they run wild  
id love to be a fairys child  
pale brows still hands and dim hair   
i had a beautiful friend    
and dreamed that the old despair  
would end in love in the end  
she looked in my heart one day            
and saw your image was there  
she has gone weeping away  
  where thou canst never see 
or shall i pray that thy dear love  
  to me might not be given           
ah no love must be pain on earth 
  if it be bliss in heaven
love is a breach in the walls a broken gate   
  where that comes in that shall not go again  
love sells the proud hearts citadel to fate   
  they have known shame who love unloved even then 
when two mouths thirsty each for each find slaking         
  and agonys forgot and hushed the crying  
of credulous hearts in heavensuch are but taking 
  their own poor dreams within their arms and lying  
each in his lonely night each with a ghost 
  some share that night but they know love grows colder          
grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most 
  astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder  
but darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss 
all this is love and all love is but this  
as i do now   
our lips meet and our eyes close   
i feel the shuddering of your breast and the beating of your throat against mine   
we are enveloped in darkness         
we know nothing but the thunder of our veins  
we are swept out into a sea of infinite oblivion
love in thine eyes doth build his tower          
  and sleeps within his pretty shrine 
and if i look the boy will lower   
  and from their orbs shoot shafts divine   
love works thy heart within his fire  
  and in my tears doth firm the same          
and if i tempt it will retire   
  and of my plaints doth make a game  
to him who ever thought with love of me   
or ever did for my sake some good deed 
i will appear looking such charity 
and kind compassion at his lifes last need 
that he will out of hand and heartily          
repent he sinned and all his sins be freed  
fair is my love when her fair golden hairs  
with the loose wind ye waving chance to mark   
fair when the rose in her red cheeks appears  
or in her eyes the fire of love does spark  
fair when her breast like a richladen bark          
with precious merchandise she forth doth lay   
fair when that cloud of pride which oft doth dark   
her goodly light with smiles she drives away  
but fairest she when so she doth display 
the gate with pearls and rubies richly dight           
through which her words so wise do make their way  
to bear the message of her gentle sprite 
  the rest be works of natures wonderment  
  but this the work of hearts astonishment 
like a cradle rocking rocking  
  silent peaceful to and fro  
like a mothers sweet looks dropping   
  on the little face below   
hangs the green earth swinging turning         
  jarless noiseless safe and slow  
falls the light of gods face bending  
  down and watching us below 
and as feeble babes that suffer 
  toss and cry and will not rest         
are the ones the tender mother   
  holds the closest loves the best  
so when we are weak and wretched   
  by our sins weighed down distressed   
then it is that gods great patience           
  holds us closest loves us best  
love let me cull her choicest flowers   
  and pity me and calm her eye 
make soft her heart dissolve her lowers         
  then will i praise thy deity  
but if thou do not love ill truly serve her  
in spite of thee and by firm faith deserve her   
he who knows love becomes love and he knows 
  all beings are himself twinborn of love        
melted in loves own fire his spirit flows  
  into all earthly forms below above   
he is the breath and glamour of the rose 
  he is the benediction of the dove   
eke eche at other threw the flours brighte 
the prymerose the violet and the golde  
so than as i beheld the riall  sighte 
my lady gan me sodenly beholde          
and with a trewe love plited manyfolde 
she smote me thrugh the very harte as blive  
and venus yet i thanke i am alive  
yet thats but a preludious bliss  
two souls pickeering in a kiss  
embraces do but draw the line   
tis storming that must take her in   
when bodies join and victory hovers         
twixt the equal fluttering lovers 
this is the game make stakes my dear   
hark how the sprightly chanticleer   
that baron tellclock of the night  
sounds boutesel to cupids knight          
  then have at all the pass is got   
  for coming off oh name it not  
  who would not die upon the spot  
the twilight fleeted away in pearl on the stream  
and night like a diamond done stood still in our dream   
your eyes like burnished stones or as stars were bright  
with the sudden vision that made us one with the night  
we loved in infinite spaces forgetting here         
the breasts that were lit with life and the lips so near   
till the wizard willows waved in the wind and drew 
me away from the fulness of love and down to you  
our love was so vast that it filled the heavens up   
but the soft white form i held was an empty cup           
when the willows called me back to earth with their sigh   
and we moved as shades through the deep that was you and i
let knowledge grow from more to more          
  but more of reverence in us dwell   
  that mind and soul according well  
may make one music as before 
but vaster we are fools and slight   
  we mock thee when we do not fear         
  but help thy foolish ones to bear   
help thy vain worlds to bear thy light   
forgive what seemed my sin in me   
  what seemed my worth since i began  
  for merit lives from man to man          
and not from man o lord to thee  
forgive my grief for one removed   
  thy creature whom i found so fair  
  i trust he lives in thee and there  
i find him worthier to be loved         
forgive these wild and wandering cries   
  confusions of a wasted youth  
  forgive them where they fail in truth  
and in thy wisdom make me wise  
oh love as long as you can love   
oh love as long as love you may   
the hour will come the hour will come   
by graves lamenting you will stay  
and ever keep your heart aglow          
and let it foster love with care   
as long as still another heart   
beats with it warmly anywhere   
if one unseals his breast to you   
ah do him all the good you can         
and all his hours with gladness fill  
and grieve him not for one hours span   
your tongueah hold it well in check   
is quick to say an evil word 
oh god it was not meant so ill         
yet pained he turns away who heard 
oh love as long as you can love   
oh love as long as love you may   
the hour will come the hour will come   
by graves lamenting you will stay          
then you kneel down before the grave  
and hide your tearful eyesalas 
they see the loved one now no more 
in long and dewy graveyard grass   
and say look down upon me here         
who by your grave am weeping still 
forgive that i have given pain  
oh god it was not meant so ill   
he sees you not and hears you not  
and seeks not your embraceah no          
the lips that kissed you oft no more  
say i forgave you long ago   
he did forgive you long ago  
and hot fell many a tear as toll 
for you and for your bitter word           
but hushhes resting at his goal 
oh love as long as you can love   
oh love as long as love you may   
the hour will come the hour will come   
by graves lamenting you will stay          
is it to me this sad lamenting strain   
are heavens choicest gifts bestowed in vain   
a plenteous fortune and a beauteous bride  
your love rewarded gratifyd your pride 
yet leaving hertis me that you pursue           
without one single charm but being new  
how vile is man how i detest their ways  
of artful falsehood and designing praise   
tasteless an easy happiness you slight  
ruin your joy and mischief your delight         
why should poor pug the mimic of your kind 
wear a rough chain and be to box confind  
some cup perhaps he breaks or tears a fan 
while roves unpunishd the destroyer man   
not bound by vows and unrestraind by shame           
in sport you break the heart and rend the fame   
not that your art can be successful here 
th already plunderd need no robber fear   
nor sighs nor charms nor flatteries can move 
too well securd against a second love           
once and but once that devil charmd my mind 
to reason deaf to observation blind  
i idly hopd what cannot love persuade 
my fondness equald and my love repaid  
slow to distrust and willing to believe         
long hushd my doubts and did myself deceive  
but oh too soonthis tale would ever last  
sleep sleep my wrongs and let me think them past   
for you who mourn with counterfeited grief 
and ask so boldly like a begging thief           
may soon some other nymph inflict the pain  
you know so well with cruel art to feign 
though long you sported with dan cupids dart  
you may see eyes and you may feel a heart  
so the brisk wits who stop the evening coach          
laugh at the fear which follows their approach 
with idle mirth and haughty scorn despise   
the passengers pale cheek and staring eyes 
but seizd by justice find a fright no jest   
and all the terror doubled in their breast          
since theres no help come let us kiss and part 
nay i have done you get no more of me   
and i am glad yea glad with all my heart  
that thus so cleanly i myself can free   
shake hands for ever cancel all our vows           
and when we meet at any time again 
be it not seen in either of our brows  
that we one jot of former love retain 
now at the last gasp of loves latest breath   
when his pulse failing passion speechless lies           
when faith is kneeling by his bed of death  
and innocence is closing up his eyes  
  now if thou wouldst when all have given him over   
  from death to life thou mightst him yet decover   
shall i compare thee to a summers day    
thou art more lovely and more temperate   
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may    
and summers lease hath all too short a date    
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines            
and often is his gold complexion dimmd   
and every fair from fair sometime declines   
by chance or natures changing course untrimmd  
but thy eternal summer shall not fade  
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest   
nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade   
when in eternal lines to time thou growest  
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see  
so long lives this and this gives life to thee    
love flooding all the creeks of my dry soul   
  from which the warm tide ebbed when i was born  
following the moon of destiny doth roll  
  his slow rich wave along the shore forlorn   
to make the oceangodand me one whole          
so shuddering in its ecstasy it lies   
  and freed from mire and tangle of the ebb   
reflects the waxing and the waning skies 
  and bears upon its panting breast the web  
of night and her innumerable eyes         
nor can conceive at all that it was blind   
  but trembling with the sharp approach of love   
that strenuous moves without one breath of wind 
  gasps as the wakening maid on whom the dove 
with folded wings of deity declined          
she in the virgin sweetness of her dream  
  thought nothing strange to find her vision true 
and i thus bathed in living rapture deem  
  no moveless drought my channel ever knew  
but rustled always with the murmuring stream          
look from thy window and see 
  my passion and my pain  
i lie on the sands below          
  and i faint in thy disdain 
let the nightwinds touch thy brow  
  with the heat of my burning sigh 
and melt thee to hear the vow 
  of a love that shall not die           
    till the sun grows cold  
    and the stars are old 
    and the leaves of the judgment  
        book unfold 
my steps are nightly driven          
  by the fever in my breast  
to hear from thy lattice breathed   
  the word that shall give me rest 
open the door of thy heart   
  and open thy chamber door          
and my kisses shall teach thy lips  
  the love that shall fade no more  
    till the sun grows cold  
    and the stars are old 
    and the leaves of the judgment          
        book unfold 
till i have peace with thee war other men  
and when i have peace can i leave thee then   
all other wars are scrupulous only thou  
o free  fair city mayst thyself allow   
to any one in flanders who can tell          
whether the master press or men rebel   
only we know that which most idiots  say  
they must bear blows which come  to part the fray   
france in her lunatic giddiness did hate    
ever our men yea and our god of late          
yet she relies upon our angels well   
which neer return no more than they which fell  
sick ireland is with a strange  war possest   
like to an ague now raging now at rest 
which time will cure yet it must do her good           
if she were purgd and her headvein  let blood 
and midas joys our spanish journeys give 
we touch all gold  but find no food to live  
and i should be in that hot  parching clime 
to dust and ashes turned before my time          
to mew me in a ship is to enthral   
me in a prison that were like to fall 
or in a cloister save that there men dwell  
in a calm heaven here in a swaying  hell  
long voyages are long consumptions         
and ships are carts for executions  
yea they are deaths is t not all one  to fly  
into another world as tis to die 
here let me war in these arms let me lie   
here let me parley batter bleed and die           
thine arms imprison me and my arms thee 
thy heart thy ransom is take mine for me   
other men war that they their rest may gain   
but we will rest that we may fight again 
those wars th ignorant these th experienced love          
there we are always under here above 
there  engines far off breed a just true fear   
near thrusts pikes stabs yea bullets hurt not here 
there lies are wrongs here safe uprightly lie  
there men kill men well make one by and by           
thou nothing i not half so much shall do  
in those wars  as they may which from us two 
shall spring thousands we see which travel not 
to war but stay swords arms and shot  
to make at home and shall not i do  then          
more glorious service staying to make men  
we are in loves land today 
    where shall we go  
love shall we start or stay 
    or sail or row  
there s many a wind and way         
and never a may but may   
we are in loves hand today 
    where shall we go  
our landwind is the breath 
of sorrows kissd to death         
    and joys that were 
our ballast is a rose  
our way lies where god knows  
    and love knows where  
    we are in loves hand today           
our seamen are fledged loves 
our masts are bills of doves 
    our decks fine gold   
our ropes are dead maids hair  
our stores are loveshafts fair          
    and manifold 
    we are in loves land today   
where shall we land you sweet  
on fields of strange mens feet 
    or fields near home           
or where the fireflowers blow  
or where the flowers of snow  
    or flowers of foam 
    we are in loves hand today   
land me she says where love         
shows but one shaft one dove   
    one heart one hand  
a shore like that my dear   
lies where no man will steer 
    no maiden land          
that love is all there is 
is all we know of love 
it is enough the freight should be 
proportioned to the groove   
farewell love and all thy laws for ever   
thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more 
senec and plato call me from thy lore  
to perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour  
in blind error when i did persever         
thy sharp repulse that pricketh aye so sore   
taught me in trifles that i set no store 
but scaped forth thence since liberty is lever  
therefore farewell go trouble younger hearts 
and in me claim no more authority          
with idle youth go use thy property   
and thereon spend thy many brittle darts 
  for hitherto though i have lost my time  
  me list no longer rotten boughs to clime  
from the lay of the last minstrel canto iii
of him i love day and night i dreamd i heard he was dead  
and i dreamd i went where they had buried him i lovebut he was not in that place  
and i dreamd i wanderd searching among burialplaces to find him    
and i found that every place was a burialplace    
the houses full of life were equally full of death this house is now            
the streets the shipping the places of amusement the chicago boston philadelphia the mannahatta were as full of the dead as of the living   
and fuller o vastly fuller of the dead than of the living    
and what i dreamd i will henceforth tell to every person and age   
and i stand henceforth bound to what i dreamd  
and now i am willing to disregard burialplaces and dispense with them     
and if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere even in the room where i eat or sleep i should be satisfied    
and if the corpse of any one i love or if my own corpse be duly renderd to powder and pourd in the sea i shall be satisfied   
or if it be distributed to the winds i shall be satisfied  
and said i that my limbs were old  
and said i that my blood was cold  
and that my kindly fire was fled   
and my poor withered heart was dead   
  and that i might not sing of love          
how could i to the dearest theme   
that ever warmed a minstrels dream   
  so foul so false a recreant prove  
how could i name loves very name  
nor wake my heart to notes of flame           
in peace love tunes the shepherds reed 
in war he mounts the warriors steed 
in halls in gay attire is seen 
in hamlets dances on the green 
love rules the court the camp the grove           
and men below and saints above 
for love is heaven and heaven is love   
true loves the gift which god has given  
to man alone beneath the heaven 
  it is not fantasys hot fire          
    whose wishes soon as granted fly   
  it liveth not in fierce desire   
    with dead desire it doth not die  
it is the secret sympathy 
the silver link the silken tie         
which heart to heart and mind to mind   
in body and in soul can bind
meli  yet what is love good shepherd sain   
fau  it is a sunshine mixed with rain   
it is a toothache or like pain

  and this is love as i hear sain 
meli  yet shepherd what is love i pray

and hopes and fears that kindle hope  
an undistinguishable throng   
and gentle wishes long subdued    
    subdued and cherishd long   
she wept with pity and delight   
she blushd with love and virgin shame    
and like the murmur of a dream   
    i heard her breathe my name   
her bosom heavedshe steppd aside  
as conscious of my look she stept   
then suddenly with timorous eye  
    she fled to me and wept   
she half enclosed me with her arms   
she pressd me with a meek embrace  
and bending back her head lookd up   
    and gazed upon my face    
twas partly love and partly fear  
and partly twas a bashful art    
that i might rather feel than see  
    the swelling of her heart    
i calmd her fears and she was calm   
and told her love with virgin pride    
and so i won my genevieve   
    my bright and beauteous bride   
it was an english ladye bright  
  the sun shines fair on carlisle wall   
and she would marry a scottish knight 
  for love will still be lord of all  
blithely they saw the rising sun           
  when he shone fair on carlisle wall 
but they were sad ere day was done 
  though love was still the lord of all  
her sire gave brooch and jewel fine   
  where the sun shines fair on carlisle wall           
her brother gave but a flask of wine  
  for ire that love was lord of all   
for she had lands both meadow and lea   
  where the sun shines fair on carlisle wall   
and he swore her death ere he would see          
  a scottish knight the lord of all   
that wine she had not tasted well  
  the sun shines fair on carlisle wall   
when dead in her true loves arms she fell  
  for love was still the lord of all          
he pierced her brother to the heart   
  where the sun shines fair on carlisle wall  
so perish all would true love part 
  that love may still be lord of all  
and then he took the cross divine          
  where the sun shines fair on carlisle wall   
and died for her sake in palestine 
  so love was still the lord of all   
now all ye lovers that faithful prove   
  the sun shines fair on carlisle wall           
pray for their souls who died for love   
  for love shall still be lord of all
i met the lovetalker one eve in the glen   
he was handsomer than any of our handsome young men  
his eyes were blacker than the sloe his voice sweeter far  
than the crooning of old kevins pipes beyond in coolnagar 
i was bound for the milking with a heart fair and free          
my grief my grief that bitter hour drained the life from me 
i thought him human lover though his lips on mine were cold  
and the breath of death blew keen on me within his hold 
i know not what way he came no shadow fell behind   
but all the sighing rushes swayed beneath a faery wind           
the thrush ceased its singing a mist crept about 
we two clung togetherwith the world shut out  
beyond the ghostly mist i could hear my cattle low   
the little cow from ballina clean as driven snow 
the dun cow from kerry the roan from inisheer         
oh pitiful their callingand his whispers in my ear 
his eyes were a fire his words were a snare   
i cried my mothers name but no help was there   
i made the blessed sign then he gave a dreary moan  
a wisp of cloud went floating by and i stood alone          
running ever through my head is an oldtime rune 
who meets the lovetalker must weave her shroud soon  
my mothers face is furrowed with the salt tears that fall 
but the kind eyes of my father are the saddest sight of all   
i have spun the fleecy lint and now my wheel is still          
the linen length is woven for my shroud fine and chill  
i shall stretch me on the bed where a happy maid i lay  
pray for the soul of mair og at dawning of the day  
  yea here the end  
of loves astonishment now know we spirit  
and who for ease of joy contriveth spirit 
now all lifes loveliness and power we have        
dissolved in this one moment and our burning   
carries all shining upward till in us 
life is not life but the desire of god  
himself desiring and himself accepting   
now what was prophecy in us is made       
fulfilment we are the hour and we are the joy 
we in our marvellousness of single knowledge   
of spirit breaking down the room of fate  
and drawing into his light the greeting fire 
of godgod known in ecstasy of love         
wedding himself to utterance of himself
yet what is love good shepherd sain  
it is a sunshine mixed with rain   
it is a toothache or like pain          
it is a game where none hath gain  
the lass saith no yet would full fain   
and this is love as i hear sain  
yet shepherd what is love i pray   
it is a yes it is a nay          
a pretty kind of sporting fray  
it is a thing will soon away 
then nymphs take vantage while ye may  
and this is love as i hear say 
yet what is love good shepherd show         
a thing that creeps it cannot go  
a prize that passeth to and fro 
a thing for one a thing for moe   
and he that proves shall find it so   
and shepherd this is love i trow           
o hearken the words of his voice of compassion 
  come cling round about me ye faithful who sicken  
of the weary unrest and the worlds passing fashion  
  as the rain in midmorning your troubles shall thicken           
  but surely within you some godhead doth quicken 
as ye cry to me heeding and leading you home   
comepain ye shall have and be blind to the ending 
  comefear ye shall have mid the skys overcasting 
comechange ye shall have for far are ye wending         
  comeno crown ye shall have for your thirst and your fasting   
  but the kissd lips of love and fair life everlasting 
cry out for one heedeth who leadeth you home   
is he gone was he with usho ye who seek saving 
  go no further come hither for have we not found it          
here is the house of fulfilment of craving  
  here is the cup with the roses around it  
  the worlds wound well healed and the balm that hath bound it 
cry out for he heedeth fair love that led home
tho the bard to purer fame may soar  
        when wild youths past  
tho he win the wise who frownd before 
        to smile at last          
        hell never meet   
        a joy so sweet 
    in all his noon of fame  
as when first he sung to womans ear  
    his soulfelt flame           
and at every close she blushd to hear  
    the one loved name 
behold love thy power how she despiseth   
my grievous pain how little she regardeth   
the solemn oath whereof she takes no cure  
broken she hath and yet she bideth sure   
right at her ease and little thee she dreadeth           
  weaponed thou art and she unarmed sitteth   
to thee disdainful all her life she leadeth   
to me spiteful without just cause or measure  
behold love how proudly she triumpheth 
  i am in hold but if thee pity moveth          
go bend thy bow that stony hearts breaketh   
and with some stroke revenge the displeasure 
of thee and him that sorrow doth endure 
and as his lord thee lowly here entreateth   
nothat hallowed form is neer forgot 
        which first love traced 
still it lingering haunts the greenest spot          
        on memorys waste 
        twas odour fled   
        as soon as shed   
    twas mornings wingd dream   
twas a light that neer can shine again          
    on lifes dull stream 
oh twas light that neer can shine again   
    on lifes dull stream
if my love knew i could wash and wring   
if my love knew i could weave and spin   
i would make a dress all of the finest kind 
but the want of money sure leaves me behind          
and still she cried i love him the best   
and a troubled mind sure can know no rest   
and still she cried bonny boys are few 
and if my love leaves me what will i do   
i know my love is an arrant rover          
i know hell wander the wide world over  
in dear old ireland hell no longer tarry   
and an english one he is sure to marry   
and still she cried i love him the best   
and a troubled mind sure can know no rest           
and still she cried bonny boys are few 
and if my love leaves me what will i do
there with thy daughter pleasure they doe play  
their hurtlesse sports without rebuke or blame   
and in her snowy bosome boldly lay  
their quiet heads devoyd of guilty shame           
after full joyance of their gentle game  
then her they crowne their goddesse and their queene 
and decke with floures thy altars well beseene 
ay me deare lord that ever i might hope   
for all the paines and woes that i endure           
to come at length unto the wished scope   
of my desire or might my selfe assure   
that happie port for ever to recure   
then would i thinke these paines no paines at all 
and all my woes to be but penance small          
then would i sing of thine immortall praise  
an heavenly hymne such as the angels sing  
and thy triumphant name then would i raise   
bove all the gods thee onely honoring   
my guide my god my victor and my king         
till then dread lord vouchsafe to take of me  
this simple song thus framd in praise of thee
from the giaour
the cold in clime are cold in blood   
  their love can scarce deserve the name 
but mine was like the lava flood 
  that boils in tnas breast of flame   
i cannot prate in puling strain          
of ladyelove and beautys chain  
if changing cheek and scorching vein 
lips taught to writhe but not complain  
if bursting heart and maddning brain   
and daring deed and vengeful steel           
and all that i have felt and feel 
betoken lovethat love was mine 
and shown by many a bitter sign 
tis true i could not whine nor sigh 
i knew but to obtain or die          
i diebut first i have possessd   
and come what may i have been blest  
shall i the doom i sought upbraid  
noreft of all yet undismayd   
but for the thought of leila slain         
give me the pleasure with the pain 
so would i live and love again  
i grieve but not my holy guide   
for him who dies but her who died 
she sleeps beneath the wandering wave         
ah had she but an earthly grave   
this breaking heart and throbbing head 
should seek and share her narrow bed  
she was a form of life and light   
that seen became a part of sight         
and rose whereer i turnd mine eye  
the morningstar of memory   
you grew a matron plump and comely  
  you dwelt in fashions brightest blaze  
my earthly lot was far more homely   
  but i too had my festal days   
no merrier eyes have ever glistend  
  around the hearthstones wintry glow   
than when my youngest child was christend   
  but that was twenty years ago   
time passd my eldest girl was married   
  and i am now a grandsire gray  
one pet of four years old ive carried  
  among the wildflowerd meads to play   
in our old fields of childish pleasure     
  where now as then the cowslips blow   
she fills her baskets ample measure   
  and that is not ten years ago  
but though first loves impassiond blindness    
  has passd away in colder light    
i still have thought of you with kindness    
  and shall do till our last goodnight  
the everrolling silent hours  
  will bring a time we shall not know  
when our young days of gathering flowers    
  will be an hundred years ago
with sence whereof whilest so thy softened spirit  
is inly toucht and humbled with meeke zeale   
through meditation of his endlesse merit         
lift up thy mind to th author of thy weale 
and to his soveraine mercie doe appeale  
learne him to love that loved thee so deare   
and in thy brest his blessed image beare 
with all thy hart with all thy soule and mind         
thou must him love and his beheasts embrace   
all other loves with which the world doth blind   
weake fancies and stirre up affections base   
thou must renounce and utterly displace 
and give thy selfe unto him full and free           
that full and freely gave himselfe to thee  
then shalt thou feele thy spirit so possest 
and ravisht with devouring great desire   
of his deare selfe that shall thy feeble brest 
inflame with love and set thee all on fire          
with burning zeale through every part entire  
that in no earthly thing thou shalt delight 
but in his sweet and amiable sight 
thenceforth all worlds desire will in thee dye 
and all earthes glorie on which men do gaze           
seeme durt and drosse in thy pure sighted eye  
compard to that celestiall beauties blaze  
whose glorious beames all fleshly sense doth daze  
with admiration of their passing light   
blinding the eyes and lumining the spright          
then shall thy ravisht soule inspired bee 
with heavenly thoughts farre above humane skil   
and thy bright radiant eyes shall plainely see  
th idee of his pure glorie present still 
before thy face that all thy spirits shall fill           
with sweete enragement of celestiall love   
kindled through sight of those faire things above
    his ganymede his life his joy   
or he comes down to me or takes me up 
    that i might be his boy  
and fill and taste and give and drink the cup  
    but those tho great are all         
      too short and small 
too weak and feeble pictures to express   
the true mysterious depths of blessedness   
  i am his image and his friend   
  his son bride glory temple end         
good mussulman abstain from pork 
there is a part in every swine   
no friend or follower of mine 
may taste whateer his inclination           
on pain of excommunication  
such mohammeds mysterious charge  
and thus he left the point at large   
had he the sinful part expressed   
they might with safety eat the rest           
but for one piece they thought it hard 
from the whole hog to be debarred  
and set their wit at work to find   
what joint the prophet had in mind 
much controversy straight arose         
these chose the back the belly those 
by some tis confidently said  
he meant not to forbid the head 
while others at that doctrine rail 
and piously prefer the tail          
thus conscience freed from every clog   
mohammedans eat up the hog   
  you laughtis well the tale applied   
may make you laugh on tother side 
renounce the world the preacher cries           
we do a multitude replies   
while one as innocent regards 
a snug and friendly game at cards  
and one whatever you may say   
can see no evil in a play         
some love a concert or a race  
and others shooting and the chase 
reviled and loved renounced and followed   
thus bit by bit the world is swallowed 
each thinks his neighbour makes too free         
yet likes a slice as well as he 
with sophistry their sauce they sweeten  
till quite from tail to snout tis eaten
what lurks in the deep gaze   
of the old wolf amaze 
hope recognition gladness anger fear       
but deeper than all these  
love muses yearns and sees 
and is the self that does not change nor veer  
 love bade me welcome yet my soul drew back    
                guiltie of dust and sinne    
but quickeyd love observing me grow slack  
                from my first entrance in    
drew nearer to me sweetly questioning            
                if i lackd any thing  
a guest i answerd worthy to be here    
                love said you shall be he   
i the unkinde ungratefull ah my deare   
                i cannot look on thee   
love took my hand and smiling did reply  
                who made the eyes but i   
truth lord but i have marrd them let my shame    
                go where it doth deserve  
and know you not sayes love who bore the blame    
                my deare then i will serve  
you must sit down sayes love and taste my meat   
                so i did sit and eat   
not love of self alone 
struggle for lair and bone         
but selfdenying love of mate and young  
love that is kind and wise   
knows trust and sacrifice 
and croons the old dark universal tongue   
alone upon the housetops to the north  
i turn and watch the lightning in the sky   
the glamour of thy footsteps in the north   
come back to me beloved or i die 
below my feet the still bazar is laid         
far far below the weary camels lie   
the camels and the captives of thy raid  
come back to me beloved or i die 
my fathers wife is old and harsh with years 
and drudge of all my fathers house am i         
my bread is sorrow and my drink is tears 
come back to me beloved or i die 
and who has understood        
our brothers of the wood  
save he who puts off guile and every guise   
of violencemade truce 
with panther bear and moose   
as beings like ourselves whom love makes wise        
for they too do loves will   
our lesser clansmen still 
the house of many mansions holds us all  
courageous glad and hale 
they go forth on the trail         
hearing the message hearkening to the call   
open the door tonight  
within your heart and light  
the lantern of love there to shine afar  
on a tumultuous sea        
some straining craft maybe  
with bearings lost shall sight loves silver star   
when the lamp is shatterd  
the light in the dust lies dead  
when the cloud is scatterd   
the rainbows glory is shed   
when the lute is broken            
sweet tones are rememberd not   
when the lips have spoken  
lovd accents are soon forgot    
as music and splendour   
survive not the lamp and the lute    
the hearts echoes render   
no song when the spirit is mute  
no song but sad dirges  
like the wind through a ruind cell    
or the mournful surges    
that ring the dead seamans knell   
when hearts have once mingld    
love first leaves the wellbuilt nest  
the weak one is singld  
to endure what it once possesst   
o love who bewailest    
the frailty of all things here   
why choose you the frailest    
for your cradle your home and your bier    
its passions will rock thee     
as the storms rock the ravens on high  
bright reason will mock thee   
like the sun from a wintry sky   
from thy nest every rafter  
will rot and thine eagle home     
leave thee naked to laughter  
when leaves fall and cold winds come   
all june i bound the rose in sheaves  
now rose by rose i strip the leaves  
and strow them where pauline may pass 
she will not turn aside alas   
let them lie suppose they die          
the chance was they might take her eye   
how many a month i strove to suit   
these stubborn fingers to the lute 
today i venture all i know  
she will not hear my music so          
break the string fold musics wing   
suppose pauline had bade me sing   
my whole life long i learnd to love  
this hour my utmost art i prove  
and speak my passionheaven or hell           
she will not give me heaven t is well  
lose who mayi still can say 
those who win heaven blessd are they   
i will row my boat on muckross lake when the grey of the dove  
comes down at the end of the day and a quiet like prayer   
grows soft in your eyes and among your fluttering hair  
the red of the sun is mixed with the red of your cheek  
i will row you o boat of my heart till our mouths have forgotten to speak           
in the silence of love broken only by trout that spring 
and are gone like a fairys finger that casts a ring 
with the luck of the world for the hand that can hold it fast 
i will rest on my oars my eyes on your eyes till our thoughts have passed   
from the lake and the sky and the rings of the jumping fish           
till our ears are filled from the reeds with a sudden swish   
and a sound like the beating of flails in the time of corn 
we shall hold our breath while a wonderful thing is born 
from the songs that were chanted by bards in the days gone by 
for a wild white swan shall be leaving the lake for the sky           
with the curve of her neck stretched out in a silver spear 
oh then when the creak of her wings shall have brought her near 
we shall hear again a swish and a beating of flails 
and a creaking of oars and a sound like the wind in sails 
as the mate of her heart shall follow her into the air          
o wings of my soul we shall think of angus and caer 
and etain and midir that were changed into wild white swans   
to fly round the ring of the heavens through the dusks and the dawns  
unseen by all but true lovers till judgment day  
because they had loved for love only o love i will say           
for a woman and man with eternity ringing them round 
and the heavens above and below them a poor thing it is to be bound 
to four low walls that will spill like a pedlars pack  
and a quilt that will run into holes and a churn that will dry and crack 
oh better than these a dream in the night or our hearts mute prayer         
that odonoghue the enchanted man should pass between water and air  
and say i will change them each to a wild white swan   
like the lovers angus and midir and their loved ones caer and etain  
because they have loved for love only and have searched through the shadows of things 
for the heart of all hearts through the fire of love and the wine of love and the wings  
then shalt thou feele thy spirit so possest  
and ravisht with devouring great desire   
of his dear selfe that shall thy feeble brest  
inflame with love and set thee all on fire          
with burning zeale through every part entire  
that in no earthly thing thou shalt delight 
but in his sweet and amiable sight 
thenceforth all worlds desire will in thee dye   
and all earthes glorie on which men do gaze

with admiration of their passing light

with heavenly thoughts farre above humane skil   
and thy bright radiant eyes shall plainely see  
th idee of his pure glorie present still 
before thy face that all thy spirits shall fill           
with sweete enragement of celestiall love   
kindled through sight of those faire things above
till i turn from female love 
and root up the infernal grove  
i shall never worthy be        
to step into eternity  
and to end thy cruel mocks 
annihilate thee on the rocks 
and another form create 
to be subservient to my fate        
let us agree to give up love   
and root up the infernal grove  
then shall we return and see  
the worlds of happy eternity 
and throughout all eternity         
i forgive you you forgive me   
as our dear redeemer said 
this the wine and this the bread  
elysium is as far as to 
the very nearest room  
if in that room a friend await   
felicity or doom 
what fortitude the soul contains           
that it can so endure   
the accent of a coming foot  
the opening of a door  
alter when the hills do  
falter when the sun 
question if his glory   
be the perfect one  
surfeit when the daffodil         
doth of the dew  
even as herself o friend 
i will of you 
you left me sweet two legacies  
a legacy of love  
a heavenly father would content 
had he the offer of 
you left me boundaries of pain           
capacious as the sea   
between eternity and time 
your consciousness and me 
mine by the right of the white election  
mine by the royal seal

and her faire lockes which formerly were bownd

sweet boy she says this night ill waste in
sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me loves master shall we meet tomorrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the
match
he tells her no tomorrow he intends
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek  she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws 
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter 
all is imaginary she doth prove
he will not manage her although he mount her 
that worse than tantalus is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy
even as poor birds deceivd with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds
missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all is vain  good queen it will not be 
she hath assayd as much as may be provd
her pleading hath deservd a greater fee
shes love she loves and yet she is not lovd
fie fie he says you crush me  let me go 
you have no reason to withhold me so
with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs
apace 
leaves love upon her back deeply distressd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus eye

come madam come all rest my powers defy 
until i labour i in labour lie
the foe ofttimes having the foe in sight
is tired with standing though he never fight
off with that girdle like heavens zone glittering
but a far fairer world encompassing
unpin that spangled breastplate which you
wear
that th eyes of busy fools may be stopped there
unlace yourself for that harmonious chime
tells me from you that now it is bedtime
off with that happy busk which i envy
that still can be and still can stand so nigh
your gown going off such beauteous state reveals
as when from flowery meads th hills shadow
steals
off with your wiry coronet and show
the hairy diadems which on you do grow
off with your hose and shoes then softly tread
in this loves hallowd temple this soft bed
in such white robes heavens angels used to be
revealed to men  thou angel bringst with thee
a heavenlike mahomets paradise and though
 spirits walk in white we easily know
by this these angels from an evil sprite
those set our hairs but these our flesh upright

 thou angel bringst with thee
a heaven like mahomets paradise

license my roving hands and let them go

oh my america my newfoundland
my kingdom safest when with one man mannd
my mine of precious stones my empery 
how am i blest in thus discovering thee
to enter in these bonds is to be free
then where my hand is set my soul shall be
full nakedness all joys are due to thee
as souls unbodied bodies unclothed must be
to taste whole joys gems which you women use
are like atlantas ball cast in mens views
that when a fools eye lighteth on a gem
his earthly soul might court that not them
like pictures or like books gay coverings made
for laymen are all women thus arrayd
themselves are only mystic books which we
whom their imputed grace will dignify
must see reveald then since that i may know
as liberally as to thy midwife show
thyself cast all yea this white linen hence
there is no penance due to innocence
to teach thee i am naked first why then
what needst thou have more covering than a

from a rapture
then as the empty bee that lately bore
into the common treasure all her store
flies bout the painted field with nimble wing
deflowring the fresh virgins of the spring
so will i rifle all the sweets that dwell
in thy delicious paradise and swell
my bag with honey drawn forth by the power
of fervent kisses from each spicy flower
ill seize the rosebuds in their perfumed bed
the violet knots like curious mazes spread
oer all the garden taste the ripened cherries
the warm firm apple tippd with coral berries
then will i visit with a wandring kiss
the vale of lilies and the bower of bliss
and where the beauteous region doth divide
into two milky ways my lip shall slide
down those smooth alleys wearing as they go
a track for lovers on the printed snow
thence climbing oer the swelling apennine
retire into the grove of eglantine
where i will all those ravished sweets distil
through loves alembic and with chymic skill
from the mixed mass one sovereign balm
derive
then bring the great elixir to thy hive
now in more subtle wreaths i will entwine
my sinewy limbs my arms and legs with thine
thou like a sea of milk shalt lie displayd
whilst i the smooth calm ocean will invade
with such a tempest as when jove of old
fell down on danae in a stream of gold 
yet my tall pinnace shall in th cyprian strait
ride safe at anchor and unload her freight
my rudder with thy bold hand like a tried
and skilful pilot thou shalt steer and guide
my bark into loves channel where it shall
dance as the bounding waves do rise or fall

i do not love to wed

but yet i would not marry

but in the bridall bed
for why that man is poore
who hath but one of many
but crownd he is with store

why then say what is he

who having two or three
will be content with one

i do not love to wed
upon julias washing herself
in the river
how fierce was i when i did see
my julia wash her self in thee
so litties thorough cristall look
so purest pebbles in the brook 
as in the river julia did
halfe with a lawne of water hid
into thy streames my self i threw
and struggling there i kist thee too
and more had done it is confest
had not thy waves forbad the rest

loves complement
 my dearest i shall grieve thee
when i swear yet sweet believe me
by thine eyes the tempting book
on which even crabbed old men look
i swear to thee though none abhor them
yet i do not love thee for them
 do not love thee for that fair
rich fan of thy most curious hair
though the wires thereof be drawn
finer than the threads of lawn
and are softer than the leaves
on which the subtle spinner weaves
i do not love thee for those flowers
growing on thy cheeksloves bowers
though such cunning hath them spread
none can part their white and red 
loves golden arrows thence are shot
yet for them i love thee not
i do not love thee for those soft  
red coral lips ive kissd so oft
nor teeth of pearl the double guard
to speech whence music still is heard 
though from those lips a kiss being taken
would tyrants melt and death awaken
i do not love thee for that fair
rich fan of thy most curious hair
i do not love thee o my fairest 
for that richestfor that rarest
silver pillar which stands under
thy round head that globe of wonder 
though that neck be whiter far
than towers of polishd ivory are
i do not love thee for those mountains
hilld with snow whence milky fountains
sugard sweets as sirupd berries
must one day run through pipes of cherries
o how much those breasts do move me 
yet for them i do not love thee
i do not love thee for that belly
sleek as satin soft as jelly
though within that crystal mound
heaps of treasure may be found
so rich that for the least of them
a king might leave his diadem
i do not love thee for those thighs
whose alabaster rocks do rise
so high and even that they stand
like seamarks to some happy land 
happy they whose eyes have seen them
but happier he that sails between them
i love thee not for thy moist palm
though the dew thereof be balm 
nor for thy pretty leg and foot
although it be the precious root
on which this goodly cedar grows 
sweet i love thee not for thosa
nor for thy wit though pure and quick
whose substance no arithmetic
can number down  nor for the charms
thou makest with thy embracing arms
though in them one night to lie
dearest i would gladly die
i love not for those eyes nor hair
nor cheeks nor lips nor teeth so rare
nor for thy speech thy neck nor breast
nor for thy belly nor the rest
nor for thy hand nor foot so small
but wouldst thou know dear sweet
for all

so spake our general mother
so spake our general mother and with eyes
of conjugal attraction unreproved
and meek surrender halfimbracing leaned
on our first father half her swelling breast
naked met his under the flowing gold
of her loose tresses hid he in delight
both of her beauty and submissive charms
smiled with superior love as jupiter
on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
that shed may flowers and pressed her matron
with kisses pure aside the devil turned
for envy  yet with jealous leer malign
eyed them askance and to himself thus
plained  
sight hateful sight tormenting  thus these
imparadised in one anothers arms
the happier eden shall enjoy their fill
of bliss on bliss  while i to hell am thrust
where neither joy nor love but fierce desire
among our other torments not the least
still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines

adam and eve
so saying she embraced him and for joy
tenderly wept much won that he his love
had so ennobled as of choice to incur
divine displeasure for her sake or death
in recompense for such compliance bad
such recompense best merits from the bough
she gave him of that fair enticing fruit
with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
against his better knowledge not deceived
but fondly overcome with female charm
earth trembled from her entrails as again
in pangs and nature gave a second groan 
sky loured and muttering thunder some sad
drops
wept at completing of the mortal sin
original  while adam took no thought
eating his fill nor eve to iterate
her former trespass feared the more to soothe
him with her loved society that now
as with new wine intoxicated both
they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
divinity within them breeding wings
wherewith to scorn the earth but that false
fruit
far other operation first displayed
carnal desire inflaming he on eve
began to cast lascivious eyes  she him
as wantonly repaid  in lust they burn
till adam thus gan eve to dalliance move 
eve now i see thou art exact of taste
and elegantof sapience no small part
 but that false fruit
far other operation first displayed
since to each meaning savour we apply
and palate call judicious i the praise
yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
from this delightful fruit nor known till now
true relish tasting if such pleasure be
in things to us forbidden it might be wished
for this one tree had been forbidden ten
but come so well refreshed now let us play
as meet is after such delicious fare
for never did thy beauty since the day
i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
with all perfections so enftame my sense
with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
than everbounty of this virtuous tree
so said he and forbore not glance or toy
of amourous intent well understood
of eve whose eye darted contagious fire
her hand he seized and to a shady bank
thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered
he led her nothing loth  flowers were the couch
pansies and violets and asphodel
and hyacinthearths freshest softest lap
there they their fill of love and loves disport
took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
the solace of their sin till dewy sleep
oppressed them wearied with their amorous play

heark my flora love doth call us
to that strife that must befal us
he has robd his mothers myrtles
and hath pulld her downy turtles
see our genial hosts are crownd
and our beds like billows rise
softer combats nowhere found
and who loses wins the prize
let not dark nor shadows fright thee
thy limbs of lustre they will light thee
fear not any can surprise us
love himself doth now disguise us
from thy waste thy girdle throw
night and darkness both dwell here
words or actions who can know
where theres neither eye nor ear
shew thy bosom and then hide it
license touching and then chide it 
give a grant and then forbear it
offer something and forswear it
ask where all our shame is gone
call us wicked wanton men
do as turtles kiss and groan 
say we neer shall meet again
i can hear thee curse yet chase thee
drink thy tears yet still embrace thee
easie riches is no treasure
she thats willing spoils the pleasure
love bids learn the wrestlers fight
pull and struggle whilst ye twine
let me use my force tonight
the next conquest shall be thine
william cartwright
heark any flora love doth call
no platonique love
tell me no more of minds embracing minds
and hearts exchangd for hearts
that spirits spirits meet as winds do winds
and mix their subtlest parts 
that two unbodid essences may kiss
and then like angels twist and feel one bliss
i was that silly thing that once was wrought
to practice this thin love
i climbd from sex to soul from soul to thought
but thinking there to move
headlong i rowld from thought to soul and
then
from soul i lighted at the sex agen
as some strict downlookd men pretend to fast
who yet in closets eat
so lovers who profess they spirits taste
feed yet on grosser meat
i know they boast they soules to soules convey
how er they meet the body is the way
come i will undeceive thee they that tread
those vain aeriall waies
are like young heyrs and alchymists misled
to waste their wealth and daies
for searching thus to be for ever rich
they only find a medcine for the itch
william cartwright
that spirits spirits meet as winds do winds
women
give me a girle if one i needs must meet
or in her nuptiall or her winding sheet 
i know but two good houres that women have
one in the bed another in the grave
thus of the whole sex all i would desire
is to enjoy their ashes or their fire
william caetwright
is to enjoy their ashes or their fire
joys unspeakable
then like some wealthy island thou shalt ly 
and like the sea about it 
thou like fair albion to the sailors sight
spreading her beauteous bosom all in white
like the kind ocean i will be
with loving arms for ever clasping thee
but ill embrace thee gentlier far than so
as their fresh banks soft rivers do
nor shall the proudest planet boast a power
of making my full love to ebb one hour
it never dry or low can prove
whilst thy unwasted fountain feeds my love
such heat and vigour shall our kisses bear
as if like doves we engendred there
no bound nor rule my pleasures shall endure
in love theres none too much an epicure
nought shall my hands or lips controul 
ill kiss thee through ill kiss thy very soul
yet nothing but the night our sports shall know 
night thats both blvnd and silent too
alphaeus found not a more secret trace
his lovd sicanian fountain to embrace
creeping so far beneath the sea
than i will do t enjoy and feast on thee
then like some wealthy island thou shalt ly 
men out of wisdom women out of pride
the pleasant thefts of love do hide
that may secure thee  but thou hast yet from me
a more infallible securitie
for theres no danger i should tell
the joys which are to me unspeakable

their rural sports and jocund strains
heavn guard us all from oupids bow
he lost his crook he left his flocks 
and wandring thro the lonely rocks
he nourishd endless woe
the nymphs and shepherds round him came
his grief some pity others blame 
the fatal cause all kindly seek
he mingled his concern with theirs 
he gave em back their friendly tears 
he sighd but would not speak
clorinda came among the rest 
and she too kind concern exprest
and askd the reason of his woe 
she askd but with an air and mein
that made it easily foreseen
she feard too much to know
the shepherd raisd his mournful head
and will you pardon me he said
while i the cruel truth reveal
which nothing from my breast should tear
which never should offend your ear
but that you bid me tell
lis thus i rove tis thus complain
since you appeard upon the plain 
you are the cause of all my care
your eyes ten thousand dangers dart
ten thousand torments vex my heart
i love and i despair
too much alexis i have heard 
tis what i thought tis what i feard
and yet i pardon you she cryd 
but you shall promise neer again
to breath your vows or speak your pain

alice is tall and upright as a pine
white as blaunchd almonds or the falling snow
sweet as are damask roses when they blow
and doubtless fruitful as the swelling vine
ripe to be cut and ready to be pressd
her full cheekd beauties very well appear
and a years fruit she loses evry year
wanting a man t improve her to the best
full fain she would be husbanded and yet
alas  she cannot a fit labrer get
to cultivate her to her own content
fain would she be god wot about her task
and yet forsooth she is too proud to ask
and which is worse too modest to consent

oome my love heres none but we
ill instruct thee how to kiss
why turn from me that dear face
why that blush and downcast eye
come come meet my fond embrace
and the mutual rapture try
throw thy lovely twining arms
round my neck or round my waist 
and whilst i devour thy charms
let me closely be embracd 
then when soft ideas rise
and the gay desires grow strong
let them sparkle in thy eyes
let them murmur from thy tongue
to my breast with rapture cling
look with transport on my face
kiss me press me everything
to endear the fond embrace
every tender name of love
in soft whispers let me hear 
and let speaking nature prove

beneath the myrtles secret shade
when delia blest my eyes
at first i viewd the lovely maid
in silent soft surprise
with trembling voice and anxious mind
i softly whisperd love
she blushd a smile so sweetly kind
did all my fears remove
her lovely yielding form i prest
sweet maddening kisses stole
and soon her swimming eyes confest
the wishes of her soul 
in wild tumultuous bliss i cry
o delia now be kind 
she pressd me close and with a sigh
to melting joys resignd

love and sleep
lying asleep between the strokes of night
i saw my love lean over my sad bed
pale as the duskiest lilys leaf or head
smoothskinned and dark with bare throat made
to bite
too wan for blushing and too warm for white
but perfectcoloured without white or red
and her lips opened amorously and said
i wist not what saving one worddelight
and all her face was honey to my mouth
and all her body pasture to mine eyes
the long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire
the quivering flanks hair smelling of the south
the bright light feet the splendid supple
thighs
and glittering eyelids of my souls desire

in the hot dust where lizards crouch
and pant he made her bridal couch 
thither down drew her to his side
and phantom taught her to be bride
with words so ardent looks so hot
she needs must feel what she had not
guess herself in beleaguered bed
and throb response thus she was wed
as she whom eus loved in a cloud
so lay she in her lovers shroud
and oer her members crept the chill
we know when mist creeps up a hill
out of the vale at eve as grows
the ivy rooting as it goes
in such a quick close envelope
she lay aswoon nor guessed the scope
nor tether of his hot intent
nor what to that inert she lent
save when at last with halfturned head
and glimmering eyes encompassed
she saw herself a bride possest
by ghostly bridegroom held and prest
to unfelt bosom saw his mouth
against her own which to his drouth
gave no allay that she could sense
nor took of her sweet recompense
so moved by pity stirred by rue
so moved by pity stirred by rue
out of their onslaught young love grew
love that with delicate tongues of fire
can kindle hearts inflamed desire
in her for him who needed it
and so she claimed and by eyes wit
had what she would and now made war
being as all sweet women are
prudes till love calls them and then fierce
in loves high calling thus with her ears
she fed on love and to her eyes
lent deeds of passionate emprise
till at the last the shadowy strife
ended she owned herself all wife

in the midnight of darkness and terror
when i would grope nearer to god
with my back to a record of error
and the highway of sin i have trod
there come to me shapes i would banish
the shapes of the deeds i have done 
and i pray and i plead till they vanish
all vanish and leave me save one
that one with a smile like the splendor
of the sun in the middleday skies
that one with a spell that is tender
that one with a dream in her eyes
cometh close in her rare southern beauty
her languor her indolent grace
and my soul turns its back on its duty
to live in the light of her face
she touches my cheek and i quiver
i tremble with exquisite pains
she sighslike an overcharged river
my blood rushes on through my veins
she smilesand in madtiger fashion
as a shetiger fondles her own
i clasp her with fierceness and passion
and kiss her with shudder and groan
once more in our loves sweet beginnings
i put away god and the world 
once more in the joys of our sinnings
are the hopes of eternity hurled
there is nothing my soul lacks or misses
as i clasp the dreamshape to my breast
in the passion and pain of her kisses
life blooms to its richest and best
o ghost of dead sin unrelenting
go back to the dust and the sod 
too dear and too sweet for repenting
ye stand between me and my god
if i by the throne should behold you
smiling up with those eyes loved so well
close close in my arms i would fold you
and drop with you down to sweet hell
ella wheeler wilcox
there come to me shapes i would banish
communism
on nights like this when my blood runs riot
with the fever of youth and its mad desires
when my brain in vain bids my heart be quiet
when my breast seems the center of lavafires
oh then is the time when most i miss you
and i swear by the stars and my soul and say
that i will have you and hold you and kiss you
though the whole world stands in the way

i was a singer in the days when pan
leapt through the roses in the month of june
and shook the petals down upon the noon 
and through the quashy brackenglades i ran
dreaming no word of how the world began
nor grieving in the graveyards of the moon
where pedants liei had a pipe a tune
and the first pagan ecstasy of man
there passed me in the pleasant forestlight
fair forms of lovers trembling into rose
that was not of the sun and no man knows
with what delirious tumult of delight
their voices filled the branches and the sight
of their fine rapture conquered all my woes
as i had bathed in that black stream that flows
across the passionless paradise of night
it seemed that life was but a game to dare
the forfeit only death and wandering
across the piney hills they heard me fling
a heart of hopeful music on the air
and there were roses roses everywhere
and birds of tuneful voice and shining wing
to carry love to god the lips of spring
had made the mouth of summer very fair
i was a singer in the days when pan
love played with us beneath the laughing trees
we praised him for his eyes and silver skin
and for the little teeth that shone within
his ruddy lips  the bracken touched his knees
and through the hours that held no count of sin
we kept his court until above our din
night westward drove her glittering argosies
oh lovely days long dead  there falls on me
in this dim world i may not understand
an echo of your sweetness in my hand
one frail sad rose inspires eternity
with dreams that are no more and from the sea
that beats upon this grey perplexed land
blows rumor of some merry drunken band
that keeps your revels still in arcady
bichabd middleton
under the staes
how the hot revels fever dies
beneath the stillness of the skies
how suddenly the whirl and glare
shoot far away and this cold air
its icy beverage brings to chase
the burning wineflush from my face 
the windows gleam still faintly falls
and music sounds at intervals
jarring the pulses of the night
with whispers of profane delight 
but on the midnights awful strand
like some wrecked swimmer flung to land
i lie and hear those breakers roar 
and smilethey cannot harm me more 
keep keep your lamps they do not mar
the silver of a single star
the painted roses you display
drop from your cheeks and fade away 
the snowy warmth you bid me see
is hollowness and mockery 
the words that make your sin so fair
grow silent in this vestal air
the loosened madness of your hair
that wrapped me in its snaky coils
no more shall mesh me in your toils
your very kisses on my brow
burn like the lips of devils now
o sacred night o virgin calm
teach me the immemorial psalm
of your eternal watch sublime
above the grovelling lusts of time 
within the orgie shouts and reels 
without the planets golden wheels
spin circling through the utmost space 
within each flushed and reckless face
is masked to cheat a haunting care 
without the silence and the prayer
within the beast of flesh controls
without the god that speaks in souls

 the planets golden wheels
spin circling through the utmost space 
shameless love
thy food my body and my blood thy wine
my soul too thine to tread beneath thy feet 
while thus my hair is gold and my breast sweet
most rapturous is this shameful life of mine
but time must come between my life and thine
when i must leave the heaven of this heat
and through the cold gray twilight go to meet
that night wherein no stars nor moon may shine
a rose then withered by fierce passions sun
left soiled and trampled in the public way 
a broken winecup emptied of delight 
yet would i not to triumph oer that day
give up one wild sweet moment of this night
that finds once more loves tune of joy begun
philip bourke marston
thy food my body and my blood thy wine 
perfume
shake out your hair about me so
that i may feel the stir and scent
of those vague odours come and go
the way our kisses went
night gave this priceless hour of love
but now the dawn steals in apace
and amorously bends above
the wonder of your face
farewell between your kisses creeps
you fade a ghost upon the air
yet ah the vacant place still keeps
the odour of your air
arthue stmons
that i may feel the stir and scent
of those vague odours come and go
magnificat
praise god who wrought for you and me
your subtle body made for love
god who from all eternity
willed our divided ways should move
together and our love should be
i wandered all these years among
a world of women seeking you
ah when our fingers met and clung
the pulses of our bodies knew
each other our hearts leapt and sung
it was not any word of mine
it was not any look of yours
only we knew and knew for sign
of love that comes love that endures
our veins the chalice of his wine
because god willed for us and planned
one perfect love excelling speech
to tell or thought to understand
he made our bodies each for each
then put your hand into my hand
arthur symons
ah when our fingers met and clung
benedictine
the benedictine scents and stains
the languor of your pallid lips
my kiss shall be a bee that sips
a fainting roseleaf flushed with rains
i thirst and yet my thirst increases
with draining deep and deeper kisses
the odour of your breath releases
desires that dream of deeper blisses
and on my lips your lips now pressed
cling moist and close your lips begin
devouringly to gather in
your kisses that my lips possessed
the odour of your breath releases
wafts of intoxicating blisses
yet still my thirst of you increases
i thirst beneath your thirsty kisses
no kisses more this perilous day
or tempting tempt me not in vain 
this day i dare not taste again
your lips that suck my soul away
arthur symons
i thirst and yet my thirst increases
leves amores
your kisses and the way you curl
delicious and distracting girl
into ones arms and round about
inextricably in and out
twining luxuriously as twine
the clasping tangles of the vine
so loving to be loved so gay
and greedy for our holiday
strong to embrace and long to kiss
and strenuous for the sharper bliss
a little tossing sea of sighs
till the slow calm seal up your eyes
and then how prettily you sleep 
you nestle close and let me keep
my straying fingers in the nest
of your warm comfortable breast 
and as i dream lying awake
of sleep well wasted for your sake
i feel the very pulse and heat
of your young lifeblood beat and beat
with mine  and you are mine my sweet 
arthur symons
twining luxuriously as twine
the clasping tangles of the vine 
idealism
i know the woman has no soul i know
the woman has no possibilities
of soul or mind or heart but merely is
the masterpiece of flesh  well be it so
it is her flesh that i adore i go
thirsting afresh to drain her empty kiss
i know she cannot love  tis not for this
i rush to her embraces like a foe
tyrannously i crave i crave alone
her body now a silent instrument
that at my touch shall wake and make for me
the strains that i have dreamed of and not
known 
her perfect body earths most eloquent
music the divine human harmony
arthur symons

 earths most eloquent
music 
bianoa
her cheeks are hot her cheeks are white
the white girl hardly breathes tonight
so faint the pulses come and go
that waken to a smouldering glow
the morbid faintness of her white
what drowsing heats of sense desire
longing and languorous the fire
of what white ashes subtly mesh
the fascinations of her flesh
into a breathing web of fire
only her eyes only her mouth
live in the agony of drouth
athirst for that which may not be 
the desert of virginity
aches in the hotness of her mouth
i take her hands into my hands
silently and she understands
i set my lips upon her lips
shuddering to her fingertips
she strains my hands within her hands
i set my lips on hers they close
into a false and phantom rose 
upon her thirsting lips i rain
a flood of kisses and in vain 
her lips inexorably close

 they close
into a false and phantom rose 
through her closed lips that cling to mine
her hands that hold me and entwine
her body that abandoned lies
rigid with sterile ecstacies
a shiver knits her flesh to mine
life sucks into a mist remote
her fainting lips her throbbing throat
her lips that open to my lips
and hot against my fingertips
the pulses leaping in her throat
arthur symons
from dust in starlight
the long days opened full and sweet
music through all their pulses beat
the sun waxed warm the trees flashed green
the birds sang loud the boughs between
their songs were in his own heart sung
and all the earth seemed once more young
his lonelinesswas it not need
of flesh for flesh so once more freed
he took a girl to walk with him
one twilight by the river dim
the lustrous flow beneath them spread
where lamps threw green and lamps threw red
and all along the shadowy walk
the lovers came to laugh and talk
to lean upon the parapet
against the river in silhouette
discussing sweet in lowest tone
the moonuntil that night unknown  
which burned behind the chimneypots
and filled with magic vacant lots
 
along the stones they scuffed their feet
loitering much for life was sweet
to count the stars above the steeple
and search the eyes of all the people
to laugh at dresses out of fashion
or some too frank display of passion
he paused to light a cigarette
she said how glad she was theyd met
watching with wistful eyes the flame
that warmly lit his handsher name
it hardly mattered thoughwas may
the name was common out her way
he took her arm  they strolled along
while bargemen sang a smutty song 
and one by one remotely then
the church bells pealed the hour of ten
 

 pretty the river was at night
when all the lanterns were alight
 
her arm beneath his thumb was warm
desire in him took eager form
the blood rose blossoming to his brain
he gripped her hand to point of pain
yes it was pretty

like romance
 
their eyes met in a furtive glance
and could not look away but burned
into each others soul and yearned
shameless and large for flesh now sweet
and the pulses beat confused with beat
 
they stood so silent swaying slightly
smile meeting intimate smile then lightly
time to go home and while she talked
along more luminous streets they walked
affecting an airiness of tone
far from the bloods intense sweet drone
and a light laughter smooth and sweet
mantling the hearts terrific beat
his hand beneath her elbow pressed
feeling the softness of her breast
her breast now his  he could not speak 
he leaned to her grown faintly weak
his lips grew dry and suddenly came
sharp realization of his shame
torrents of memories filled his brain
clouding the fleshs bliss with pain
whirling his thoughts out like a wind
was it betrayalhad he sinned
tumult ensued he felt her arm
under his hand so living warm
and feeling this he closed his eyes
forbade those troubling dreams to rise
and suddenly laughed more swiftly walking
listened intently started talking
and squeezed her hand for answer came
a smile indulgent free from shame
a smile that stripped her body bare
let down her goldenladdered hair
 
within her room she stood a space
to doff her hat  then raised her face
drowsy to kiss with halfshut eyes
and clung he felt her full breast rise
quivering soft beneath his breast
body to aching body pressed
knee sought for knee to fuse with it
mouth upon mouth fed exquisite
fierce hand caught shoulder yielding waist
flesh drank of flesh to pain embraced
slowly ecstatically moving
greedy of every seconds loving
till weakening with the ultimate kiss
she opened soft her mouth to his
torrential flesh the darkness fell
far off ran reelings of a bell
around the sky then all was still
save for vague steps that climbed a hill
that climbed and climbed drew ever near
came up grew swift swelled loud and clear
brought rush of winds confusing roar
huge waters upon a sandy shore
reverberating falling beating
withdrawing rhythmical repeating
filling the night the seas the air
rising and falling everywhere
withdrawal slow succeeding rush
clamor and hush  clamor and hush
 
vast bells upon his body rang
clang upon liberating clang
the whole world cracked and opened up
and spilled its splendor like a cup
for stony limits cannot hold love out 
and what love can do that dares love attempt 
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
jul if they do see thee they will murder thee
rom alack there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords  look thou but sweet
and i am proof against their enmity
jul i would not for the world they saw thee
here
rom i have nights cloak to hide me from their
sight 
and but thou love me let them find me here 
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued wanting of thy love
 love poems
jul by whose direction foundst thou out this
place 
rom by love who first did prompt me to
inquire 
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot  yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea
i would adventure for such merchandise
jul thou knowst the mask of night is on my
face
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form  fain fain deny
what i have spoke  but farewell compliment
dost thou love me  i know thou wilt say  ay 
and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst
thou mayst prove false  at lovers perjuries
they say jove laughs o gentle romeo
if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully 
or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won
ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
so thou wilt woo  but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond
and therefore thou mayst think my havior light 
but trust me gentleman ill prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess
but that thou overheardst ere i was ware
my true loves passion  therefore pardon me
and not impute this yielding to light love
which the dark night hath so discovered
love poems 
rom lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruittree tops 
jul o swear not by the moon the inconstant
moon
that monthly changes in her circled orb 
lest that thy love prove likewise variable
rom what shall i swear by 
jul do not swear at all 
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry
and ill believe thee
rom if my hearts dear love 
jul well do not swear although i joy in
thee
i have no joy of this contract tonight 
it is too rash too unadvised too sudden
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say  it lightens sweet goodnight
this bud of love by summers ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
goodnight goodnight  as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast
rom oh wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 
jul what satisfaction canst thou have tonight 
rom the exchange of thy loves faithful vow
for mine
jul i gave thee mine before thou didst request
and yet i would it were to give again
rom wouldst thou withdraw it for what pur
pose love
 love poems
jul but to be frank and give it thee again
and yet i wish but for the thing i have 
my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep  the more i give to thee
the more i have  for both are infinite
i hear some noise within dear love adieu
william shakespeare
to celia
drink to me only with thine eyes
and i will pledge with mine 
or leave a kiss but in the cup
and ill not ask for wine
the thirst that from the soul doth rise
doth ask a drink divine 
but might i of joves nectar sip
i would not change for thine
i sent thee late a rosy wreath
not so much honoring thee
as giving it a hope that there
it could not withered be
but thou thereon didst only breathe
and sentst it back to me 
since when it grows and smells i swear
not of itself but thee

serenade
ah sweet thou little knowest how
i wake and passionate watches keep 
and yet while i address thee now
methinks thou smilest in thy sleep
tis sweet enough to make me weep
that tender thought of love and thee
that while the world is hushed so deep
thy souls perhaps awake to me
sleep on sleep on sweet bride of sleep
with golden visions for thy dower
while i this midnight vigil keep
and bless thee in thy silent bower 
to me tis sweeter than the power
of sleep and fairy dreams unfurled
that i alone at this still hour
in patient love outwatch the world

ye banks and braes and streams around
the castle o montgomery
green be your woods and fair your flowers
your waters never drumlie
there simmer first unfauld your robes
and there the langest tarry 
for there i took the last fareweel
o my sweet highland mary
love poems 
how sweetly bloomed the gay green birk
how rich the hawthorns blossom
as underneath their fragrant shade
i clasped her to my bosom 
the golden hours on angel wings
flew oer me and my dearie 
for dear to me as light and life
was my sweet highland mary
wi monie a vow and locked embrace
our parting was fu tender 
and pledging aft to meet again
we tore oursels asunder 
but oh fell deaths untimely frost
that nipt my flower sae early 
now greens the sod and caulds the clay
that wraps my highland mary
o pale pale now those rosy lips
i aft hae kissd sae fondly
and closed for aye the sparkling glance
that dwelt on me sae kindly
and mouldring now in silent dust
that heart that loed me dearly
but still within my bosoms core
shall live my highland mary robert burns
 love poems
come rest in this bosom
come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer
though the herd have fled from thee thy home is
still here 
here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last
oh what was love made for if tis hot the same
through joy and through torment through glory
and shame
i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart
i but know that i love thee whatever thou art
thou hast called me thy angel in moments of bliss
and thy angel ill be through the horrors of this 
through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to
pursue
and shield thee and save thee  or perish there
thomas moore
she was a phantom of delight
she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamed upon my sight 
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moments ornament 
her eyes as stars of twilight fair 
like twilights too her dusky hair 
but all things else about her drawn
from maytime and the cheerful dawn 
love poems 
a dancing shape an image gay
to haunt to startle and waylay
i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin liberty 
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records promises as sweet 
a creature not too bright or good
for human natures daily food 
for transient sorrows simple wiles
praise blame love kisses tears and smiles
and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine 
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveller between life and death 
the reason firm the temperate will
endurance foresight strength and skill 
a perfect woman nobly planned
to warn to comfort and command 
and yet a spirit still and bright
with something of an angel light
william wordsworth
she walks in beauty
she walks in beauty like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all thats best of dark and bright
 love poems
meets in her aspect and her eyes 
thus mellowed to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies
one shade the more one ray the less
had halfimpaired the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens oer her face
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure how dear their dwellingplace
and on that cheek and oer that brow
so soft so calm yet eloquent
the smiles that win the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent 
a mind at peace with all below
a heart whose love is innocent
lord byron
ruth
she stood breast high amid the corn
clasped by the golden light of morn
like the sweetheart of the sun
who many a glowing kiss had won
on her cheek an autumn flush
deeply ripened  such a blush
in the midst of brown was born
like red poppies grown with corn
love poems 
round her eyes her tresses fell 
which were blackest none could tell
but long lashes veiled a light
that had else been all too bright
and her hat with shady brim
made her tressy forehead dim  
thus she stood amid the stooks
praising god with sweetest looks 
sure i said heaven did not mean
where i reap thou shouldst but glean 
lay thy sheaf adown and come
share my harvest and my home
thomas hood
when we two parted
when we two parted
in silence and tears
half brokenhearted
to sever for years
pale grew thy cheek and cold
colder thy kiss 
truly that hour foretold
sorrow to this
the dew of the morning
sunk chill on my brow 
i felt like the warning
of what i feel now
 love poems
thy vows are all broken
and light is thy fame 
i hear thy name spoken
and share in its shame
they name thee before me
a knell to mine ear
a shudder comes oer me 
why wert thou so dear
they know not i knew thee
who knew thee too well  
long long shall i rue thee
too deeply to tell
in secret we met 
in silence i grieve
that thy heart could forget
thy spirit deceive
if i should meet thee
after long years
how should i greet thee 
in silence and tears
lord byron
to the lady hamilton
too late i stayed  forgive the crime 
unheeded flew the hours 
how noiseless falls the foot of time
that only treads on flowers 
love poems 
what eye with clear account remarks
the ebbing of the glass
when all its sands are diamond sparks
that dazzle as they pass 
oh who to sober measurement
times happy swiftness brings
when birds of paradise have lent
their plumage for his wings 
hon william robert spencer
angel and woman
 when your beauty appears
in its graces and airs
all bright as an angel newdropt from the skies
at distance i gaze and am awed by my fears
so strangely you dazzle my eyes
 but when without art
your kind thoughts you impart
when your love runs in blushes through every vein
when it darts from your eyes when it pants at
your heart 
then i know that youre woman again
 theres a passion and pride
in our sex she replied
 and thus might i gratify both i would do 
still an angel appear to each lover beside
but still be a woman to you

 love poems
immortality of love
they sin who tell us love can die
with life all other passions fly
all others are but vanity 
in heaven ambition cannot dwell
nor avarice in the vaults of hell 
earthly these passions of the earth
they perish where they have their birth 
but love is indestructible 
its holy flame forever burneth 
from heaven it came to heaven returneth
too oft on earth a troubled guest
at times deceived at times oppressed
it here is tried and purified
then hath in heaven its perfect rest 
it soweth here with toil and care
but the harvesttime of love is there
robert southev
from the angel in the house
to heroism and holiness
how hard it is for man to soar
but how much harder to be less
than what his mistress loves him for
he does with ease what do he must
or lose her and theres nought debarrd
from him whos calld to meet her trust
love poems 
and credit her desired regard
ah wasteful woman she that may
on her sweet self set her own price
knowing he cannot choose but pay
how has she cheapend paradise 
how given for nought her priceless gift
how spoild the bread and spilld the wine
which spent with due respective thrift
had made brutes men and men divine
 queen awake to thy renown
require what tis our wealth to give
and comprehend and wear the crown
of thy despised prerogative 
 who in manhoods name at length
with glad songs come to abdicate
the gross regality of strength
must yet in this thy praise abate
that through thine erring humbleness
and disregard of thy degree
mainly has man been so much less
than fits his fellowship with thee
high thoughts had shaped the foolish brow
the coward had graspd the heros sword
the vilest had been great hadst thou
just to thyself been worths reward 
but lofty honors undersold
seller and buyer both disgrace 
and favor that makes folly bold
puts out the light in virtues face
 love poems
then to my room
i went and closed and lockd the door
and cast myself down on my bed
and there with many a blissful tear
i vowd to love and prayd to wed
the maiden who had grown so dear 
thankd god who had set her in my path 
and promised as i hoped to win
i never would sully my faith
by the least selfishness or sin 
whatever in her sight id seem
id really be  id never blend
with my delight in her a dream
twould change her cheek to comprehend 
and if she wished it id prefer
anothers to my own success 
and always seek the best for her
with unofficious tenderness
rising i breathed a brighter clime
and found myself all self above
and with a charity sublime
contemned not those who did not love
and i could not but feel that then
i shone with something of her grace
and went forth to my fellow men
my commendation in my face
she was all mildness  yet twas writ
upon her beauty legibly
 he thats for heaven itself unfit
love poems 
let him not hope to merit me
and such a challenge quite apart
from thoughts of love humbled and thus
to sweet repentance moved my heart
and made me more magnanimous
and led me to review my life
inquiring where in aught the least
if question were of her for wife
 might be mended hope increased 
not that i soared so far above
myself as this great hope to dare 
and yet i half foresaw that love
might hope where reason would despair

drama
he stood beside me
the embodied vision of the brightest dream
which like a dawn heralds the day of life 
the shadow of his presence made my world
a paradise all familiar things he touched
all common words he spoke became to me
like forms and sounds of a diviner world
he was as is the sun in his fierce youth
as terrible and lovely as a tempest 
he came and went and left me what i am

in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee
and a spirit in my feet
hath led me  who knows how
to the chamber window sweet
love poems 
the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream 
the champak odors fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream 
the nightingales complaint
it dies upon her heart
as i must die on thine
beloved as thou art 
oh lift me from the grass 
i die i faint i fail 
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white alas
my heart beats loud and fast 
oh press it close to thine again
where it will break at last

to lucasta on going to the wars
tell me not sweet i am unkind
that from the nunnery
of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
to war and arms i fly
true a new mistress now i chase

and with a stronger faith embrace
a sword a horse a shield
 love poems
yet this inconstancy is such
as you too shall adore 
i could not love thee dear so much
loved i not honor more
richard lovelace
tis sweet to think
tis sweet to think that whereer we may rove
we are sure to find something blissful and dear
and that when were far from the lips we love
weve but to make love to the lips we are near
the heart like a tendril accustomed to cling
let it grow where it will cannot flourish alone
but will lean to the nearest and loveliest thing
it can twine with itself and make closely its own
then oh  what pleasure whereer we rove
to be sure to find something still that is dear
and to know when far from the lips we love
weve but to make love to the lips we are near
twere a shame when flowers around us rise
to make light of the rest if the rose isnt there 
and the worlds so rich in resplendent eyes
twere a pity to limit ones love to a pair
loves wing and the peacocks are nearly alike
they are both of them bright but theyre change
able too
and wherever a new beam of beauty can strike
it will tincture loves plume with a different hue
love poems 
then oh what pleasure whereer we rove
to be sure to find something still that is dear
and to know when far from the lips we love
weve but to make love to the lips we are near

the evening time
together we walked in the evening time
above us the sky spread golden and clear
and he bent his head and looked in my eyes
as if he held me of all most dear
oh it was sweet in the evening time
grayer the light grew and grayer still
the rooks flitted home through the purple shade 
the nightingales sang where the thorns stood high
as i walked with him in the woodland glade
oh it was sweet in the evening time
and our pathway went through fields of wheat 
narrow that path and rough the way
but he was near and the birds sang true
and the stars came out in the twilight gray
oh it was sweet in the evening time
softly he spoke of the days long past
softly of blessed days to be 
close to his arm and closer i prest
the cornfield path was eden to me
oh it was sweet in the evening time
 love poems
and the latest gleams of daylight died 
my hand in his enfolded lay 
we swept the dew from the wheat as we passed
for narrower narrower wound the way
oh it was sweet in the evening time
he looked in the depths of my eyes and said
 sorrow and gladness will come for us sweet 
but together well walk through the fields of life
close as we walked through the fields of wheat

the daydream
the departure
and on her lovers arm she leant
and round her waist she felt it fold
and far across the hills they went
in that new world which is the old 
across the hills and far away
beyond their utmost purple rim
and deep into the dying day
the happy princess followed him
id sleep another hundred years
o love for such another kiss  
oh wake forever love she hears
o love twas such as this and this
and oer them many a sliding star
and many a merry wind was borne
and streamed through many a golden bar
the twilight melted into morn
 love poems
 o eyes long laid in happy sleep 
o happy sleep that lightly fled
 o happy kiss that woke thy sleep  
 o love thy kiss would wake the dead  
and oer them many a flowing range
of vapor buoyed the crescent bark
and rapt through many a rosy change
the twilight died into the dark
 a hundred summers can it be
and whither goest thou tell me where
 o seek my fathers court with me
for there are greater wonders there  
and oer the hills and far away
beyond their utmost purple rim
beyond the night across the day
through all the world she followed him

then most i pine for thee 
bend on me then thy tender eyes
as stars look on the sea
 love poems
for thoughts like waves that glide by night
are stillest when they shine
mine earthly love lies hushed in light
beneath the heaven of thine
there is an hour when angels keep
familiar watch oer men
when coarser souls are wrapped in sleep 
sweet spirit meet me then
there is an hour when holy dreams
through slumber fairest glide
and in that mystic hour it seems
thou shouldst be at my side
my thoughts of thee too sacred are
for daylights common beam 
i can but know thee as my star
my angel and my dream 
when stars are in the quiet skies
then most i pine for thee 
bend on me then thy tender eyes
as stars look on the sea

loves thread of gold
in the night she told a story
in the night and all night through
while the moon was in her glory
and the branches dropped with dew
love poems 
twas my life she told and round it
rose the years as from a deep 
in the worlds great heart she found it
cradled like a child asleep
in the night i saw her weaving
by the misty moonbeam cold
all the weft her shuttle cleaving
with a sacred thread of gold j
ah  she wept me tears of sorrow
lulling tears so mystic sweet 
then she wove my last tomorrow
and her web lay at my feet
of my life she made the story 
i must weep  so soon twas told
but your name did lend it glory
and your love its thread of gold

to h playing one of mendelssohns  lieder ohne worte
your favorite picture rises up before me
wheneer you play that tune
i see two figures standing in a garden
in the still august noon
one is a girls with pleading face turned upward
wild with a great alarm 
 love poems
trembling with haste she binds her broidered ker
chief
about the others arm
whose face is bent on her with tender pity
whose eyes look into hers
with a deep meaning though she cannot read it
hers are so dim with tears
what are they saying in the sunny garden
with summer flowers ablow
what gives the womans voice its passionate plead
what makes the mans so low
 see love she murmurs  you shall wear my ker
chief
it is the badge i know 
and it shall bear you safely thro the conflict
if ifindeed you go
 you will not wear it  will not wear my kerchief
nay do not tell me why
i will not listen if you go without it
you will go hence to die
 hush do not answer it is death i tell you
indeed i speak the truth 
you standing there so warm with life and vigor
so bright with health and youth
love poems 
 you would go hence out of the glowing sunshine
out of the gardens bloom
out of the living thinking feeling present
into the unknown gloom 
then he makes answer hush oh hush my dar
ling
life is so sweet to me
so full of hope you need not bid me guard it
if such a thing might be
if such a thing might be  but not thro falsehood 
i could not come to you
i dare not stand here in your pure sweet presence
knowing myself untrue
it is no sin the wild voice interrupts him
 this is no open strife 
have you not often dreamt a nobler warfare
in which to spend your life
 oh  for my sake  though but for my sake wear it
think what my life would be
if you who gave it first true worth and meaning
were taken now from me 
think of the long long days so slowly passing
think of the endless years
i am so young must i live out my lifetime
with neither hopes nor fears
 love poems
he speaks again in mournful tones and tender
but with unswerving faith 
 should not love make us braver aye and stronger
either for life or death 
and life is hardest oh my love my treasure
if i could bear your part
of this great sorrow i would go to meet it
with an unshrinking heart
 child  child  i little dreamt in that bright summer
when first your love i sought
of all the future store of woe and anguish
which i unknowing wrought
 but youll forgive me  yes you will forgive me
i know when i am dead
i would have loved you  but words have scant
meaning 
god love you now instead 
and there is silence in the sunny garden
until with faltering tone
she sobs the while still clinging closer to him
 forgive me go  my own  
so human love and faith by death unshaken
mingle their glorious psalm 
albeit low until the passionate pleading
is hushed in deepest calm

goodnight
goodnight no love the night is ill
which severs those it should unite 
let us remain together still 
then it will be good night
how were the night without thee good
though thy sweet wishes wing its flight
be it not said thought understood 
then it will be good night
the hearts that on each other beat
from evening close to morning light
have nights as good as they are sweet
but never say  goodnight

hearts
a trinket made like a heart dear
of red gold bright and fine
was given to me for a keepsake
given to me for mine
and another heart warm and tender
as true as a heart could be 
and every throb that stirred it
was always and all for me
h love poems
sailing over the waters
watching the far blue land
i dropped my golden heart dear
dropt it out of my hand 
it lies in the cold blue waters
fathoms and fathoms deep
the golden heart which i promised
promised to prize and keep
gazing at lifes bright visions
so false and fair and new
i forgot the other heart dear
forgot it and lost it too 
i might seek that heart forever
i might seek and seek in vain 
and for one short careless hour
i pay with a life of pain
adelaide anne procter
a heart for every one
oh theres a heart for every one
if every one could find it 
then up and seek ere youth is gone
whateer the toil neer mind it 
for if you chance to meet at last
with that one heart intended
to be a blessing unsurpassed
till life itself is ended
love poems 
how would you prize the labor done
how grieve if you resigned it 
for theres a heart for every one
if every one could find it
two hearts are made the angels say
to suit each other dearly 
but each one takes a different way 
a way not found so clearly
yet though we seek and seek for years
the pains are worth the taking
for what the life of home endears
like hearts of angels making
then haste and guard the treasure now
when fondly youve enshrined it
for theres a heart for every one
if every one could find it charles swain
i waited till the twilight
i waited till the twilight
and yet he did not come 
i strayed along the brookside
and slowly wandered home 
when who should come behind me
but him i would have chid 
he said he came to find me 
do you really think he did
 love poems
he said since last we parted
hed thought of naught so sweet
as of this very moment 
the moment we should meet
he showed me where halfshaded
a cottage home lay hid 
he said for me hed made it 
do you really think he did 
he said when first he saw me
life seemed at once divine
each night he dreamed of angels
and every face was mine 
sometimes a voice in sleeping
would all his hopes forbid 
and then hed waken weeping 
do you really think he did

rest
love give me one of thy dear hands to hold
take thou my tired head upon thy breast 
then sing me that sweet song we loved of old
the dear soft song about our little nest
we knew the song before the nest was ours 
we sang the song when first the nest we found 
we loved the song in happy afterhours
when peace came to us and content profound
then sing that olden song to me tonight
while  reclining on thy faithful breast
love poems 
see happy visions in the fair firelight
and my whole soul is satisfied with rest
better than all our bygone dreams of bliss
are deep content and rest secure as this
what though we missed loves golden summertime
his autumn fruits were ripe when we had leave
to enter joys wide vineyard in our prime
good guerdon for our waiting to receive
love gave us no frail pledge of summer flowers
but side by side we reaped the harvestfield 
now side by side we pass the winter hours
and day by day new blessings are revealed
the heyday of our youth its roseate glow
its high desires and cravings manifold
the raptures and delights of long ago
have passed  but we have truer joys to hold
sing me the dear old song about the nest
our blessed home our little ark of rest
all the year round
twin stars aloft
twin stars aloft in ether clear
around each other roll alway
within one common atmosphere
of their own mutual light and day
and myriad happy eyes are bent
upon their changeless love alway 
as strengthened by their one intent
they pour the flood of life and day
 love poems
so we through this worlds waning night
shall hand in hand pursue our way 
shed round us order love and light
and shine unto the perfect day
charles kingsley
love took me softly by the hand
love took me softly by the hand
love led me all the country oer
and showed me beauty in the land
that i had never seen before 
never before  never before 
o love sweet love
there was a glory in the morn
there was a calmness in the night
a mildness in the south wind borne
that i have never felt aright
never aright  never aright 
o love sweet love
but now it cannot pass away 
i feel it wheresoeer i go
and in my heart by night and day
its gladness moveth to and fro 
by night and day  by night and day 
o love sweet love

song
nay but you who do not love her
is she not pure gold my mistress
holds earth aught  speak truth  above her
aught like this tress see and this tress
and this last fairest tress of all
so fair see ere i let it fall 
because you spend your lives in praising 
to praise you search the wide world over 
then why not witness calmly gazing
if earth holds aught  speak truth  above her
above this tress and this i touch
but cannot praise i love so much

song
when sparrows build and the leaves break forth
my old sorrow wakes and cries
for i know there is dawn in the far far north
and a scarlet sun doth rise
like a scarlet fleece the snowfield spreads
and the icy founts run free
and the bergs begin to bow their heads
and plunge and sail in the sea
 love poems
o my lost love and my own own love
and my love that loved me so
is there never a chink in the world above
where they listen for words from below 
nay i spoke once and i grieved thee sore
i remember all that i said
and now thou wilt hear me no more  no more
till the sea gives up her dead 
thou didst set thy foot on the ship and sail
to the icefields and the snow 
thou wert sad for thy love did not avail
and the end i could not know 
how could i tell i should love thee today
whom that day i held not dear
how could i know i should love thee away
when i did not love thee anear
we shall walk no more through the sodden plain
with the faded bents oerspread 
we shall stand no more by the seething main
while the dark wrack drives oerhead 
we shall part no more in the wind and the rain
where thy last farewell was said 
but perhaps i shall meet thee and know thee again
when the sea gives up her dead

destiny
somewhere there waiteth in this world of ours
for one lone soul another lonely soul
each choosing each through all the weary hours
and meeting strangely at one sudden goal
then blend they like green leaves with golden
flowers
into one beautiful and perfect whole 
and lifes long night is ended and the way
lies open onward to eternal day

light
the night has a thousand eyes
and the day but one
yet the light of the bright world dies
with the dying sun
the mind has a thousand eyes
and the heart but one
yet the light of a whole life dies
when love is done

cupids arrow
young cupid went storming to vulcan one day
and besought him to look at his arrow
 tis useless  he cried  you must mend it i say
tisnt fit to let fly at a sparrow
theres something thats wrong in the shaft or the
dart
for it flutters quite false to my aim
tis an age since it fairly went home to a heart
and the world really jests at my name
 i have straightened ive bent ive tried all i
declare
ive perfumed it with sweetest of sighs 
tis feathered with ringlets my mother might wear
and the barb gleams with light from young eyes 
but it falls without touching  ill break it i vow
for theres hymen beginning to pout
hes complaining his torch beams so dull and so low
that zephyr might puff it right out
little cupid went on with his pitiful tale
till vulcan the weapon restored 
 there take it young sir try it now if it fail
i will ask neither fee nor reward  
the urchin shot out and rare havoc he made
the wounded and dead were untold
but no wonder the rogue had such slaughtering trade
for the arrow was laden with gold

love poems
two lovers
two lovers by a mossgrown spring 
they leaned soft cheeks together there
mingled the dark and sunny hair
and heard the wooing thrushes sing
o budding time
o loves blest prime
two wedded from the portal stept 
the bells made happy carolings
the air was soft as fanning wings
white petals on the pathway slept
o pureeyed bride
o tender pride
two faces oer a cradle bent 
two hands above the head were locked 
these pressed each other while they rocked
those watched a life that love had sent
o solemn hour
o hidden power
two parents by the evening fire 
the red light fell about their knees
on heads that rose by slow degrees
like buds upon the lilyspire
o patient life
o tender strife
 love poems
the two still sat together there
the red light shone about their knees 
but all the heads by slow degrees
had gone and left that lonely pair
o voyage fast 
o vanished past
the red light shone upon the floor
and made the space between them wide 
they drew their chairs up side by side
their pale cheeks joined and said  once more 
o memories
o past that is

the lowbacked car
when first i saw sweet peggy
twas on a market day 
a lowbacked car she drove and sat
upon a truss of hay 
but when that hay was blooming grass
and decked with flowers of spring
no flower was there that could compare
with the blooming girl i sing
as she sat in the lowbacked car
the man at the turnpike bar
never asked for the toll
but just rubbed his owld poll
and looked after the lowbacked car
love poems 
in battles wild commotion
the proud and mighty mars
with hostile scythes demands his tithes
of death in warlike cars 
while peggy peaceful goddess
has darts in her bright eye
that knock men down in the market town
as right and left they fly 
while she sits in her lowbacked car
than battle more dangerous far  
for the doctors art
cannot cure the heart
that is hit from that lowbacked car
sweet peggy robnd her car sir
has strings of ducks and geese
but the scores of hearts she slaughters
by far outnumber these 
while she among her poultry sits
just like a turtledove
well worth the cage i do engage
of the blooming god of love
while she sits in her lowbacked car
the lovers come near and far 
and envy the chicken
that peggy is pickin
as she sits in her lowbacked car
oh id rather own that car sir
with peggy by my side
than a coach and four and gold galore
and a lady for my bride 
 love poems
for a lady would sit forninst me
on a cushion made with taste
while peggy would sit beside me
with my arm around her waist 
while we drove in the lowbacked car
to be married by father mahar 
oh my heart would beat high
at her glance and her sigh 
though it beat in a lowbacked car
samuel lover
come into the garden maud
come into the garden maud
for the black bat night has flown
come into the garden maud
i am here at the gate alone 
and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad
and the musk of the roses blown
for a breeze of morning moves
and the planet of love is on high
beginning to faint in the light that she loves
on a bed of daffodil sky
to faint in the light of the sun she loves
to faint in his light and to die
all night have the roses heard
the flute violin bassoon 
all night has the casement jessamine stirred
to the dancers dancing in tune 
love poems 
till a hush fell with the waking bird
and a hush with the setting moon
i said to the lily   there is but one
with whom she has heart to be gay
when will the dancers leave her alone
she is weary of dance and play
now half to the setting moon are gone
and half to the rising day 
low on the sand and loud on the stone
the last wheel echoes away
i said to the rose   the brief night goes
in babble and revel and wine
o young lordlover what sighs are those
for one that will never be thine
but mine but mine so i sware to the rose
 forever and ever mine
and the soul of the rose went into my blood
as the music clashed in the hall 
and long by the garden lake i stood
for i heard your rivulet fall
from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood
our wood that is dearer than all
from the meadow your walks have left so sweet
that whenever a marchwind sighs
he sets the jewelprint of your feet
in violets blue as your eyes
 love poems
to the woody hollows in which we meet
and the valleys of paradise
the slender acacia would not shake
one long milkbloom on the tree 
the white lakeblossom fell into the lake
as the pimpernel dozed on the lea 
but the rose was awake all night for your sake
knowing your promise to me 
the lilies and roses were all awake
they sighed for the dawn and thee
queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
come hither the dances are done
in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls
queen lily and rose in one 
shine out little head sunning over with curls
to the flowers and be their sun
there has fallen a splendid tear
from the passionflower at the gate
she is coming my dove my dear 
she is coming my life my fate 
the red rose cries  she is near she is near  
and the white rose weeps  she is late  
the larkspur listens  i hear i hear  
and the lily whispers  i wait
she is coming my own my sweet 
were it ever so airy a tread
my heart would hear her and beat
were it earth in an earthy bed 
love poems 
my dust would hear her and beat
had i lain for a century dead 
would start and tremble under her feet
and blossom in purple and red

 era gia lora che volge il desio  dante
 ricorro al tempo chio vi vidi prima  petrarca
i wish i could remember that first day
first hour first moment of your meeting me
if bright or dim the season it might be
summer or winter for aught i can say 
so unrecorded did it slip away
so blind was i to see and to foresee
so dull to mark the budding of my tree
that would not blossom yet for many a may
if only i could recollect it such
a day of days  i let it come and go
as traceless as a thaw of bygone snow 
it seemed to mean so little meant so much 
if only now i could recall that touch
first touch of hand in hand  did one but know
 e drizzeremo gli occhi al primo amore  dante
 ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia  petrarca
if i could trust mine own self with your fate
shall i not rather trust it in gods hand
without whose will one lily doth not stand
 love poems
nor sparrow fall at his appointed date 
who numbereth the innumerable sand
who weighs the wind and water with a weight
to whom the world is neither small nor great
whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned
searching my heart for all that touches you
i find there only love and loves goodwill
helpless to help and impotent to do
of understanding dull of sight most dim 
and therefore i commend you back to him
whose love your loves capacity can fill
 amor che ne la mente mi ragiona  dante
 amor vien nel bel viso di costei  pftrarca
if there be any one can take my place
and make you happy whom i grieve to grieve
think not that i can grudge it but believe
i do commend you to that nobler grace
that readier wit than mine that sweeter face 
yea since your riches make me rich conceive
i too am crowned while bridal crowns i weave
and thread the bridal dance with jocund pace
for if i did not love you it might be
that i should grudge you some one dear delight 
but since the heart is yours that was mine own
your pleasure is my pleasure right my right
your honorable freedom makes me free
and you companioned i am not alone
christina g rossetti
love poems 
because
it is not because your heart is mine mine onlymine alone 
it is not because you chose me weak and lonely
for your own 
not because the earth is fairer and the skies
spread above you
are more radiant for the shining of your eyes 
that i love you
it is not because the worlds perplexed meaning
grows more clear 
and the parapets of heaven with angels leaning
seem more near 
and nature sings of praise with all her voices
since yours spoke
since within my silent heart that now rejoices
love awoke
nay not even because your hand holds heart and
life 
at your will
soothing hushing all its discord making strife
calm and still 
teaching trust to fold her wings nor ever roam
from her nest 
teaching love that her securest safest home
must be rest
 love poems
but because this human love though true and
sweet 
yours and mine 
has been sent by love more tender more complete
more divine 
that it leads our hearts to rest at last in heaven
far above you 
do i take you as a gift that god has given 
and i love you

how can ye bloom sae fresh and fair 
how can ye chant ye little birds

i love my jean
o a the airts the wind can blaw
i dearly loe the west
for there the bonnie lassie lives
the lass that i loe best 
there wild woods grow and rivers row
wi mony a hill between 
but day and night my fancys flight
is ever wi my jean
i see her in the dewy flowers
sae lovely sweet and fair 
i hear her voice in ilka bird
wi music charm the air 
theres not a bonnie flower that springs
by fountain shaw or green 
theres not a bonnie bird that sings
but minds me o my jean robert burns
a valediction
god be with thee my beloved  god be with thee 
else alone thou goest forth
thy face unto the north
moor and pleasance all around thee and beneath
thee
looking equal in one snow 
while i who try to reach thee
vainly follow vainly follow
 love poems
with the farewell and the hollo
and cannot reach thee so
alas i can but teach thee
god be with thee my beloved  god be with thee
can i teach thee my beloved can i teach thee 
if i said  go left or right
the counsel would be light
the wisdom poor of all that could enrich thee
my right would show like left 
my raising would depress thee
my choice of light would blind thee of way would leave behind thee
of end would leave bereft
alas i can but bless thee 
may god teach thee my beloved may god teach
thee
can i bless thee my beloved can i bless thee
what blessing word can i
from mine own tears keep dry
what flowers grow in my field wherewith to dress
thee
my good reverts to ill 
my calmnesses would move thee
my softnesses would prick thee
my bindings up would break thee
my crownings curse and kill
alas i can but love thee
may god bless thee my beloved may god bless
thee
love poems 
can i love thee my beloved  can i love thee 
and is this like love to stand
with no help in my hand
when strong as death i fain would watch above
thee
my lovekiss can deny
no tear that falls beneath it 
mine oath of love can swear thee
from no ill that comes near thee 
and thou diest while i breathe it
and i  i can but die 
may god love thee my beloved may god love
thee

a chain
the bond that links our souls together 
will it last through stormy weather
will it moulder and decay
as the long hours pass away
will it stretch if fate divide us
when dark and weary hours have tried us
o if it look too poor and slight
let us break the links tonight 
it was not forged by mortal hands
or clasped with golden bars and bands 
save thine and mine no other eyes
the slender link can recognize 
 love poems
in the bright light it seems to fade 
and it is hidden in the shade 
while heaven nor earth have never heard
or solemn vow or blighted word
yet what no mortal hand could make
no mortal power can ever break 
what words or vows could never do
no words or vows can make untrue 
and if to other hearts unknown
the dearer and the more our own
because too sacred and divine
for other eyes save thine and mine
and see though slender it is made
of love and trust and can they fade 
while if too slight it seem to bear
the breathings of the summer air
we know that it could bear the weight
of a most heavy heart of late
and as each day an hour flew
the stronger for its burden grew
and too we know and feel again
it has been sanctified by pain
for what god deigns to try with sorrow
he means not to decay tomorrow 
but through that fiery trial at last
when earthly ties and bonds are past 
what slighter things dare not endure
will make our love more safe and pure
love poems 
love shall be purified by pain
and pain be soothed by love again 
so let us now take heart and go
cheerfully on through joy and woe 
no change the summer sun can bring
or the inconstant skies of spring
or the bleak winters stormy weather
for we shall meet them love together
adelaide anne procter
love wakes and weeps
love wakes and weeps
while beauty sleeps 
oh  for musics softest numbers
to prompt a theme
for beautys dream
soft as the pillow of her slumbers
through groves of palm
sigh gales of ialm 
fireflies on the air are wheeling 
while through the gloom
comes soft perfume
the distant beds of flowers revealing
oh wake and live
no dreams can give
a shadowed bliss the real excelling 
no longer sleep 
from lattice peep
and list the tale that love is telling

 love poems
in three days
so i shall see her in three days
and just one night but nights are short 
then two long hours and that is morn
see how i come unchanged unworn
feel where my life broke off from thine
how fresh the splinters keep and fine 
only a touch and we combine
too long this time of year the days
but nights at least the nights are short
as night shows where her one moon is
a hands breadth of pure light and bliss
so lifes night gives my lady birth
and my eyes hold her what is worth
the rest of heaven the rest of earth 
o loaded curls release your store
of warmth and scent as once before
the tingling hair did lights and darks
out breaking into fairy sparks
when under curl and curl i pried
after the warmth and scent inside
through lights and darks how manifold 
the dark inspired the light controlled
as early art embrowns the gold
what great fear should one say  three days
that change the world might change as well
your fortune  and if joy delays
be happy that no worse befell
love poems 
what small fear if another says
 three days and one short night beside
may throw no shadow on your ways
but years must turn with change untried
with chance not easily defied
with an end somewhere undescried
no fear or if a fear be born
this minute it dies out in scorn
fear i shall see her in three days
and one night now the nights are short
then just two hours and that is morn

the bonnie wee thing
bonnie wee thing cannie wee thing
lovely wee thing wast thou mine
i wad wear thee in my bosom
lest my jewel i should tine
wistfully i look and languish

lest my wee thing be na mine
wit and grace and love and beauty
in ae constellation shine 
to adore thee is my duty
goddess o this soul o mine

bonnie wee thing cannie wee thing
lovely wee thing wast thou mine
i wad wear thee in my bosom

ill never love thee more
my dear and only love i pray
that little world of thee
be governed by no other sway
than purest monarchy 
for if confusion have a part
which virtuous souls abhor
and hold a synod in thy heart
ill never love thee more
as alexander i will reign
and i will reign alone 
my thoughts did evermore disdain
a rival on my throne
he either fears his fate too much
or his deserts are small
who dares not put it to the touch
to gain or lose it all
but i will reign and govern still
and always give the law
and have each subject at my will
and all to stand in awe 
 love poems
but gainst my batteries if i find
thou storm or vex me sore
as if thou set me as a blind
ill never love thee more
and in the empire of thy heart
where i should solely be
if others do pretend a part
or dare to share with me 
or committees if thou erect
or go on such a score
ill smiling mock at thy neglect
and never love thee more
but if no faithless action stain
thy love and constant word
ill make thee famous by my pen
and glorious by my sword 
ill serve thee in such noble ways

love in my bosom like a bee
doth suck his sweet 
now with his wings he plays with me
now with his feet
love poems 
within mine eyes he makes his nest
his bed amidst my tender breast 
my kisses are his daily feast
and yet he robs me of my rest 
ah wanton will ye 
and if i sleep then percheth he
with pretty flight
and makes his pillow of my knee
the livelong night
strike i my lute he tunes the string 
he music plays if so i sing 
he lends me every lovely thing
yet cruel he my heart doth sting 
whist wanton still ye
else i with roses every day
will whip you hence
and blind you when you long to play
for your offence 
ill shut mine eyes to keep you in 
ill make you fast it for your sin 
ill count your power not worth a pin 
alas what hereby shall i win
if he gainsay me 
what if i beat the wanton boy
with many a rod
he will repay me with annoy
because a god
then sit thou safely on my knee
love poems
and let thy bower my bosom be 
lurk in mine eyes i like of thee
o cupid so thou pity me
spare not but play thee

song
ask me no more where jove bestows
when june is past the fading rose 
for in your beauties orient deep
these flowers as in their causes sleep
ask me no more whither do stray
the golden atoms of the day 
for in pure love heaven did prepare
those powders to enrich your hair
ask me no more whither doth haste
the nightingale when may is past 
for in your sweet dividing throat
she winters and keeps warm her note
ask me no more if east or west
the phoenix builds her spicy nest 
for unto you at last she flies
and in your fragrant bosom dies 
thomas carew
the passionate shepherd to his
love
come live with me and be my love
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hill and valley grove and field
gy mountains yield
 love poems
and we will sit upon the rocks
seeing the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers to whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals
and i will make thee beds of roses
and a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroidered all with leaves of myrtle 
a gown made of the finest wool
which from our pretty lambs we pull 
fairlined slippers for the cold
with buckles of the purest gold
a belt of straw and ivy buds
with coral clasps and amber studs 
and if these pleasures may thee move
come live with me and be my love
the shepherd swains shall dance and sing
for thy delight each maymorning
if these delights thy mind may move
come live with me and be my love

move eastward happy earth
move eastward happy earth and leave
yon orange sunset waning slow 
from fringes of the faded eve
o happy planet eastward go 
love poems 
till over thy dark shoulder glow
thy silver sisterworld and rise
to glass herself in dewy eyes
that watch me from the glen below
ah bear me with thee lightly borne
dip forward under starry light
and move me to my marriagemorn
and round again to happy night

serenade
now the toils of day are over
and the sun hath sunk to rest
seeking like a fiery lover
the bosom of the blushing west 
the faithful night keeps watch and ward
raising the moon her silver shield
and summoning the stars to guard
the slumbers of my fair mathilde
the faithful night now all things lie
hid by her mantle dark and dim
in pious hope i hither hie
and humbly chant mine evening hymn
thou art my prayer my saint my shrine
for never holy pilgrim kneeld
or wept at feet more pure than thine
my virgin love my sweet mathilde

 love poems
my star
all that i know
of a certain star
is it can throw
like an angled spar
now a dart of red
now a dart of blue
till my friends have said
they would fain see too
my star that dartles the red and the blue i
then it stops like a bird  like a flower hangs furled 
they must solace themselves with the saturn
above it
what matter to me if their star is a world
mine has opened its soul to me  therefore i
love it
robert browning
when thou art near me
when thou art near me
sorrow seems to fly
and then i think as well i may
that on this earth there is no one
more blest than i
but when thou leavst me
doubts and fears arise
and darkness reigns
where all before was light
love poems 
the sunshine of my soul
is in those eyes
and when they leave me
all the world is night
but when thou art near me
sorrow seems to fly
and then i feel as well i may
that on this earth there dwells not one
so blest as i lady john scott
one morning oh  so early
one morning oh so early my beloved my be
loved
all the birds were singing blithely as if never they
would cease 
twas a thrush sang in my garden  hear the story
hear the story  
and the lark sang  give us glory  
and the dove said  give us peace 
then i listened oh so early my beloved my be
loved
to that murmur from the woodland of the dove my
dear the dove 
when the nightingale came after  give us fame to
sweeten duty
when the wren sang  give us beauty 
she made answer  give us love 
 love poems
sweet is spring and sweet the morning my be
loved my beloved 
now for us doth spring doth morning wait upon
the years increase
and my prayer goes up  oh give us crowned in
youth with marriage glory
give for all our lifes dear story
give us love and give us peace

before the daybreak
before the daybreak shines a star
that in the days great glory fades 
too fiercely bright is the full light
that her palegleaming lamp upbraids
before the daybreak sings a bird
that stills her song ere morning light 
too loud for her is the days stir
the woodlands thousandtongued delight
ah great the honor is to shine
a light wherein no traveller errs 
and rich the prize to rank divine
among the worlds loud choristers
but i would be that paler star
and i would be that lonelier bird
to shine with hope while hopes afar
and sing of love when loves unheard

love poems 
a warning
place your hands in mine dear
with their roseleaf touch 
if you heed my warning
it will spare you much
ah  with just such smiling
unbelieving eyes
years ago i heard it  
you shall be more wise
you have one great treasure
joy for all your life 
do not let it perish
in one reckless strife
do not venture all child
in one frail weak heart 
so through any shipwreck
you may save a part
where your soul is tempted
most to trust your fate
there with double caution
linger fear and wait
measure all you give still
counting what you take 
love for love so placing
each an equal stake
love poems
treasure love  though readystill to live without in your fondest trust keep
just one thread of doubt
build on no tomorrow 
love has but today 
if the links seem slackening
cut the bond away
trust no prayer nor promise 
words are grains of sand 
to keep your heart unbroken
hold it in your hand
that your love may finish
calm as it begun learn this lesson better
dear than i have done
years hence perhaps this warning
you shall give again in just the selfsame words dear
and just as much  in vain

to mary
i seem in the midst of the crowd
the lightest of all 
my laughter rings cheery and loud
in banquet and ball
love poems 
my lip hath its smiles and its sneers
for all men to see 
but my soul and my truth and my tears
are for thee are for thee 
around me they flatter and fawn 
the young and the old
the fairest are ready to pawn
their hearts for my gold
they sue me  i laugh as i spurn
the slaves at my knee 
but in faith and in fondness i turn
unto thee unto thee

the invitation
best and brightest come away
fairer far than this fair day
which like thee to those in sorrow
comes to bid a sweet goodmorrow
to the rough year just awake
in its cradle on the brake
the brightest hour of unborn spring
through the winter wandering
found it seems the halcyon morn
to hoar february born 
bending from heaven in azure mirth
it kissed the forehead of the earth
and smiled upon the silent sea
and bade the frozen streams be free
love poems
and waked to music all their fountains
and breathed upon the frozen mountains
and like a prophetess of may
strewed flowers upon the barren way
making the wintry world appear
like one on whom thou smilest dear
away away from men and towns
to the wild wood and the downs 
to the silent wilderness
where the soul need not repress
its music lest it should not find
an echo in anothers mind
while the touch of natures art
harmonizes heart to heart
radiant sister of the day
awake arise and come away
to the wild woods and the plains
to the pools where winter rains
image all their roof of leaves
where the pine its garland weaves
of sapless green and ivy dun 
round stems that never kiss the sun 
where the lawns and pastures be
and the sandhills of the sea
where the melting hoarfrost wets
the daisystar that never sets
and windflowers and violets
which yet join not scent to hue
crown the pale year weak and new 
love poems 
when the night is left behind
in the deep east dim and blind
and the blue noon is over us
and the multitudinous
billows murmur at our feet
where the earth and ocean meet
and all things seem only one
in the universal sun
percy bysshe shelley
the millers daughter
it is the millers daughter
and she is grown so dear so dear
that i would be the jewel
that trembles at her ear 
for hid in ringlets day and night
i touch her neck so warm and white
and i would be the girdle
about her dainty dainty waist
and her heart would beat against me
in sorrow and in rest
and i should know if it beat right
id clasp it round so close and tight
and i would be the necklace
and all day long to fall and rise
upon her balmy bosom
with her laughter cr her sighs
and i would lie so light so light
i scarce should be unclaspd at night
alfred tennyson
 love poems
a voice by the cedar tree
a voice by the cedar tree
in the meadow under the hall
she is singing an air that is known to me
a passionate ballad gallant and gay
a martial song like a trumpets call
singing alone in the morning of life
in the happy morning of life and of may
singing of men that in battle array
ready in heart and ready in hand
march with banner and bugle and fife
to the death for their native land
maud with her exquisite face
and wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky
and feet like sunny gems on an english green
maud in the light of her youth and her grace
singing of death and of honor that cannot die
till i well could weep for a time so sordid and
mean
and myself so languid and base
ill
silence beautiful voice
be still for you only trouble the mind
with a joy in which i cannot rejoice
a glory i shall not find
love poems 
still i will hear you no more
for your sweetness hardly leaves me a choice
but to move to the meadow and fall before
her feet on the meadow grass and adore
not her who is neither courtly nor kind
not her not her but a voice
alfred tennyson
divided
an empty sky a world of heather
purple of foxglove yellow of broom 
we two among them wading together
shaking out honey treading perfume
crowds of bees are giddy with clover
crowds of grasshoppers skip at our feet
crowds of larks at their matins hang over
thanking the lord for a life so sweet
flusheth the rise with her purple favor
gloweth the cleft with her golden ring
twixt the two brown butterflies waver
lightly settle and sleepily swing
we two walk till the purple dieth
and short dry grass under foot is brown
but one little streak at a distance lieth
green like a ribbon to prank the down
 love poems
over the grass we stepped unto it
and god he knoweth how blithe we were
never a voice to bid us eschew it 
hey the green ribbon that showed so fair
hey the green ribbon we kneeled beside it
we parted the grasses dewy and sheen 
drop over drop there filtered and slided
a tiny bright beck that trickled between
tinkle tinkle sweetly it sung to us
light was our talk as of faery bells 
faery weddingbells faintly rung to us
down in their fortunate parallels
hand in hand while the sun peered over
we lapped the grass on that youngling spring 
swept back its rushes smoothed its clover
and said  let us follow it westering
a dapple sky a world of meadows
circling above us the black rooks fly
forward backward  lo their dark shadows
flit on the blossoming tapestry 
flit on the beck for her long grass parteth
as hair from a maids bright eyes blown back 
and lo the sun like a lover darteth
his flattering smile on her wayward track
love poems 
sing on we sing in the glorious weather
till one steps over the tiny strand
so narrow in sooth that still together
on either brink we go hand in hand
the beck grows wider the hands must sever
on either margin our songs all done
we move apart while she singeth ever
taking the course of the stooping sun
he prays  come over   i may not follow 
i cry  return   but he cannot come 
we speak we laugh but with voices hollow 
our hands are hanging our hearts are numb
a breathing sigh a sigh for answer
a little talking of outward things 
the careless beck is a merry dancer
keeping sweet time to the air she sings
a little pain when the beck grows wider
 cross to me now  for her wavelets swell  
 i may not cross   and the voice beside her
faintly reacheth though heeded well
no backward path  ah  no returning 
no second crossing that ripples flow 
 come to me now for the west is burning 
come ere it darkens     ah no ah no 
 love poems
then cries of pain and arms outreaching 
the beck grows wider and swift and deep 
passionate words as of one beseeching 
the loud beck drowns them  we walk and weep
a yellow moon in splendor drooping
a tired queen with her state oppressed
low by rushes and swordgrass stooping
lies she soft on the waves at rest
the desert heavens have felt her sadness 
her earth will weep her some dewy tears 
the wild beck ends her tune of gladness
and goeth stilly as soul that fears
we two walk on in our grassy places
on either marge of the moonlit flood
with the moons own sadness in our faces
where joy is withered blossom and bud
a shady freshness chafers whirring
a little piping of leafhid birds 
a flutter of wings a fitful stirring
a cloud to the eastward snowy as curds
bare glassy slopes where kids are tethered 
round valleys like nests all fernylined 
round hills with fluttering treetops feathered
swell high in their freckled robes behind
love poems 
a roseflush tender a thrill a quiver
when golden gleams to the treetops glide 
a flashing edge for the milkwhite river
the beck a river with still sleek tide
broad and white and polished as silver
on she goes under fruitladen trees 
sunk in leafage cooeth the culver
and plaineth of loves disloyalties
glitters the dew and shines the river
up comes the lily and dries her bell 
but two are walking apart forever
and wave their hands for a mute farewell
a braver swell a swifter sliding 
the river hasteth her banks recede 
winglike sails on her bosom gliding
bear down the lily and drown the reed
stately prows are rising and bowing
shouts of mariners winnow the air
and level sands for banks endowing
the tiny green ribbon that showed so fair
while o my heart as white sails shiver
and crowds are passing and banks stretch wide
how hard to follow with lips that quiver
that moving speck on the faroff side 
 love poems
farther farther  i see it know it 
my eyes brim over it melts away 
only my heart to my heart shall show it
as i walk desolate day by day
viii
and yet i know past all doubting truly 
and knowledge greater than grief can dim 
i know as he loved he will love me duly 
yea better een better than i love him
and as i walk by the vast calm river
the awful river so dread to see
i say  thy breadth and thy depth forever
are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me
jean ingelow
a birdsong
its a year almost that i have not seen her 
oh  last summer green things were greener
brambles fewer the blue sky bluer
its wellnigh summer for theres a swallow 
come one swallow his mate will follow
the birdrace quicken and wheel and thicken
o happy swallow whose mate will follow
oer height oer hollow id be a swallow
to build this weather our nest together

love poems 
when i think on the happy days
i spent wi you my dearie
and now what lands between us lie
how can i but be eerie
how slow ye move ye heavy hours
as ye were wae and weary 
it was na sae ye glinted by
when i was wi my dearie
anonymous
to althea from prison
when love with unconfined wings
hovers within my gates
and my divine althea brings
to whisper at the grates 
when i lie tangled in her hair
and fetterd to her eye
the birds that wanton in the air
know no such liberty
stone walls do not a prison make
nor iron bars a cage 
minds innocent and quiet take
that for a hermitage 
if i have freedom in my love
and in my soul am free
angels alone that soar above
enjoy such liberty
richard lovelace
 love poems
songs from the princess
ask me no more  the moon may draw the sea 
the cloud may stoop from heaven and take the
shape
with fold to fold of mountain or of cape 
but o too fond when have i answerd thee
ask me no more
ask me no more  what answer should i give
i love not hollow cheek or faded eye 
yet o my friend i will not have thee die
ask me no more lest i should bid thee live 
ask me no more
ask me no more  thy fate and mine are seald 
i strove against the stream and all in vain 
let the great river take me to the main 
no more dear love for at a touch i yield 
ask me no more
as thro the land at eve we went
and pluckd the ripend ears
we fell out my wife and i
o we fell out i know not why
and kissd again with tears
and blessings on the falling out
that all the more endears
when we fall out with those we love
and kiss again with tears
love poems 
for when we came where lies the child
we lost in other years
there above the little grave
o there above the little grave
we kissd again with tears
 o swallow swallow flying flying south
fly to her and fall upon her gilded eaves
and tell her tell her what i tell to thee
 o tell her swallow thou that knowest each
that bright and fierce and fickle is the south
and dark and true and tender is the north
 o swallow swallow if i could follow and light
upon her lattice i would pipe and trill
and cheep and twitter twenty million loves
 o were i thou that she might take me in
and lay me on her bosom and her heart
would rock the snowy cradle till i died
 why lingereth she to clothe her heart with
love
delaying as the tender ash delays
to clothe herself when all the woods are green 
 o tell her swallow that thy brood is flown 
say to her i do but wanton in the south
but in the north long since my nest is made
 love poems
 o tell her brief is life but love is long 
and brief the sun of summer in the north
and brief the moon of beauty in the south
 o swallow flying from the golden woods
fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her
mine
and tell her tell her that i follow thee
alfred tennyson
song of the violet
a humble flower long time i pined
upon the solitary plain
and trembled at the angry wind
and shrunk before the bitter rain
and oh  twas in a blessed hour
a passing wanderer chanced to see
and pitying the lonely flower
to stoop and gather me
i fear no more the tempest rude
on dreary heath no more i pine
but left my cheerless solitude
to deck the breast of caroline
alas  our days are brief at best
nor long i fear will mine endure
though sheltered here upon a breast
so gentle and so pure
love poems 
it draws the fragrance from my leaves
it robs me of my sweetest breath
and every time it falls and heaves
it warns me of my coming death
but one i know would glad forego
all joys of life to be as i 
an hour to rest on that sweet breast
and then contented die
william makepeace thackeray
love in a life
room after room
i hunt the house through
we inhabit together
heart fear nothing for heart thou shalt find her
next time herself   not the trouble behind her
left in the curtain the couchs perfume
as she brushed it the cornicewreath blossomed
anew 
yon lookingglass gleamed at the wave of her
feather
yet the day wears
and door succeeds door 
i try the fresh fortune 
range the wide house from the wing to the centre
still the same chance she goes out as i enter
spend my whole day in the quest who cares
but tis twilight you see with such suits to explore
such closets to search such alcoves to importune 
robert browning
 love poems
love
love is not made of kisses or of sighs
of clinging hands or of the sorceries
and subtle witchcrafts of alluring eyes
love is not made of broken whispers  no
nor of the blushing cheek whose answering glow
tells that the ear has heard the accents low
love is not made of tears nor yet of smiles
of quivering lips or of enticing wiles 
love is not tempted  he himself beguiles
this is loves language but this is not love
if we know aught of love how shall we dare
to say that this is love when well aware
that these are common things and love is rare
as separate streams may blending ever roll
in course united so of soul to soul
love is the union into one sweet whole
as molten metals mingle  as a chord
swells sweet in harmony  when love is lord
two hearts are one as letters form a word
one heart one mind one soul and one desire
a kindred fancy and a sister fire
of thought and passion these can love inspire
this makes a heaven of earth  for this is love

love poems 
life in a love
escape me 
never 
beloved 
while i am i and you are you
so long as the world contains us both
me the loving and you the loth
while the one eludes must the other pursue
my life is a fault at last i fear 
it seems too much like a fate indeed
though i do my best i shall scarce succeed
but what if i fail of my purpose here 
it is but to keep the nerves at strain
to dry ones eyes and laugh at a fall
and baffled get up and begin again 
so the chase takes up ones life thats all
while look but once from your farthest bound
at me so deep in the dust and dark
no sooner the old hope goes to ground
than a new one straight to the selfsame mark
i shape me 
ever removed robert browning
not ours the vows
not ours the vows of such as plight
their troth in sunny weather
while leaves are green and skies are bright
to walk on flowers together
 love poems
but we have loved as those who tread
the thorny path of sorrow
with clouds above and cause to dread
yet deeper gloom tomorrow
that thorny path those stormy skies
have drawn our spirits nearer
and rendered us by sorrows ties
each to the other dearer
love born in hours of joy and mirth
with mirth and joy may perish 
that to which darker hours gave birth
still more and more we cherish
it looks beyond the clouds of time
and through deaths shadowy portal
made by adversity sublime
by faith and hope immortal
bernard barton
for the future
i wonder did you ever count
the value of one human fate 
or sum the infinite amount
of one hearts treasures and the weight
of lifes one venture and the whole concentrate
purpose of a soul
love poems 
and if you ever paused to think
that all this in your hands i laid
without a fear   did you not shrink
from such a burden  half afraid
halfwishing that you could divide the risk or cast
it all aside
while love has daily perils such
as none foresee and none control 
and hearts are strung so that one touch
careless or rough may jar the whole
you well might feel afraid to reign with absolute
power of joy and pain
you well might fear if loves sole claim
were to be happy  but true love
takes joy as solace not as aim
and looks beyond and looks above 
and sometimes through the bitterest strife first
learns to live her highest life
earth forges joy into a chain
till fettered love forgets its strength
its purpose and its end  but pain
restores its heritage at length
and bids love rise again and be eternal mighty
pure and free
if then your future life should need
a strength my love can only gain
through suffering or my heart be freed
 love poems
only by sorrow from some stain
then you shall give and  will take this crown of
fire for loves dear sake
adelaide anne procter
comfort
if there should come a time as well there may
when sudden tribulation smites thine heart
and thou dost come to me for help and stay
and comfort  how shall i perform my part
how shall i make my heart a restingplace
a shelter safe for thee when terrors smite
how shall i bring the sunshine to thy face
and dry thy tears in bitter woes despite
how shall i win the strength to keep my voice
steady and firm although i hear thy sobs
how shall i bid thy fainting soul rejoice
nor mar the counsel by mine own heartthrobs
love my love teaches me a certain way
so if thy dark hour come i am thy stay
i must live higher nearer to the reach
of angels in their blessed trustfulness
learn their unselfishness ere i can teach
content to thee whom i would greatly bless
ah me what woe were mine if thou shouldst come
troubled but trusting unto me for aid
and i should meet thee powerless and dumb
willing to help thee but confused afraid
love poems 
it shall not happen thus for i will rise
god helping me to higher life and gain
courage and strength to give thee counsel wise
and deeper love to bless thee in thy pain
fear not dear love thy trial hour shall be
the dearest bond between my heart and thee
all the year round
seven times three love
i leaned out of window i smelt the white clover
dark dark was the garden i saw not the gate 
 now if there be footsteps he comes my one
lover 
hush nightingale hush o sweet nightingale
wait
till i listen and hear
if a step draweth near
for my love he is late
the skies in the darkness stoop nearer and nearer
a cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree
the fall of the water comes sweeter comes clearer 
to what art thou listening and what dost thou
let the starclusters grow
let the sweet waters flow
and cross quickly to me
 love poems
you night moths that hover where honey brims
over
from sycamore blossoms or settle or sleep 
you glowworms shine out and the pathway discover
to him that comes darkling along the rough steep
ah my sailor make haste
for the time runs to waste
and my love lieth deep 
 too deep for swift telling  and yet my one lover
ive conned thee an answer it waits thee tonight
by the sycamore passed he and through the white
clover
then all the sweet speech i had fashioned took
flight
but ill love him more more
than eer wife loved before
be the days dark or bright

the violet
the violet in her greenwood bower
where birchen boughs with hazels mingle
may boast itself the fairest flower
in glen or copse or forest dingle
though fair her gems of azure hue
beneath the dewdrops weight reclining 
ive seen an eye of lovelier blue
more sweet through watery lustre shining
love poems 
the summer sun that dew shall dry
ere yet the day be passed its morrow 
no longer in my false loves eye
remained the tear of parting sorrow

song
in love if love be love if love be ours
faith and unfaith can neer be equal powers 
unfaith in aught is want of faith in all
it is the little rift within the lute
that by and by will make the music mute
and ever widening slowly silence all
the little rift within the lovers lute
or little pitted speck in garnered fruit
that rotting inward slowly moulders all
it is not worth the keeping  let it go 
but shall it answer darling answer no
and trust me not at all or all in all

one way of love
all june i bound the rose in sheaves
now rose by rose i strip the leaves
and strew them where pauline may pass
love poems
she will not turn aside alas
let them lie suppose they die
the chance was they might take her eye
how many a month i strove to suit
these stubborn fingers to the lute
today i venture all i know
she will not hear my music so
break the string  fold musics wing 
suppose pauline had bade me sing
my whole life long i learned to love
this hour my utmost art i prove
and speak my passion  heaven or hell 
she will not give me heaven tis well
lose who may i still can say
those who win heaven blest are they

i meeting
again i see my bliss at hand
the town the lake are here 
my marguerite smiles upon the strand
unaltered with the year
love poems 
i know that graceful figure fair
that cheek of languid hue 
i know that soft enkerchiefed hair
and those sweet eyes of blue
again i spring to make my choice 
again in tones of ire
i hear a gods tremendous voice 
 be counselled and retire
ye guiding powers who join and part
what would ye have with me 
ah warn some more ambitious heart
and let the peaceful be 
ii parting
ye stormwinds of autumn
who rush by who shake
the window and ruffle
the gleamlighted lake 
who cross to the hillside
thinsprinkled with farms
where the high woods strip sadly
their yellowing arms 
ye are bound for the mountains
ah with you let me go
where your cold distant barrier
the vast range of snow
through the loose clouds lifts dimly

its white peaks in air
how deep is there stillness
ah would i were there
but on the stairs what voice is this i hear
buoyant as morning and as morning clear
say has some wet birdhaunted english lawn
lent it the music of its trees at dawn 
or was it from some sunflecked mountain brook
that the sweet voice its upland clearness took 
ah it comes nearer 
sweet notes this way
hark fast by the window
the rushing winds go
to the icecumbered gorges
the vast seas of snow
there the torrents drive upward
their rockstrangled hum 
there the avalanche thunders
the hoarse torrent dumb
i come o ye mountains
ye torrents i come
but who is this by the halfopened door
whose figure casts a shadow on the floor
the sweet blue eyes  the soft ashcolored hair 
the cheeks that still their gentle paleness wear 
the lovely lips with their arched smile that tells
the unconquered joy in which her spirit dwells 
ah they bend nearer 
sweet lips this way
love poems 
hark the wind rushes past us
ah with that let me go
to the clear waning hillside
unspotted by snow
there to watch oer the sunk vale
the frore mountain wall
where the niched snowbed sprays down
its powdery fall
there its dusky blue clusters
the aconite spreads 
there the pines slope the cloudstrips
hung soft in their heads
no life but at moments
the mountain bees hum
 i come o ye mountains
ye pinewoods i come
forgive me forgive me
ah marguerite fain
would these arms reach to clasp thee
but see tis in vain
in the void air towards thee
my stretched arms are cast 
but a sea rolls between us 
our different past
to the lips ah of others
those lips have been prest
and others ere i was
were strained to that breast
 love poems
far far from each other
our spirits have grown
and what heart knows another
ah who knows his own
blow ye winds lift me with you
i come to the wild
fold closely o nature
thine arms round thy child
to thee only god granted
a heart ever new 
to all always open
to all always true
ah  calm me restore me 
and dry up my tears
on thy high mountain platforms
where morn first appears 
where the white mists forever
are spread and upfurled 
in the stir of the forces
whence issued the world
iii a farewell
my horses feet beside the lake
where sweet the unbroken moonbeams lay
sent echoes through the night to wake
each glistening strand each heathfringed bay
love poems ill
the poplar avenue was passed
and the roofed bridge that spans the stream 
up the steep street i hurried fast
led by thy tapers starlike beam
i came i saw thee rise the blood
poured flushing to thy languid cheek
locked in each others arms we stood
in tears with hearts too full to speak
days flew  ah soon i could discern
a trouble in thine altered air
thy hand lay languidly in mine
thy cheek was grave thy speech grew rare
i blame thee not this heart i know
to be long loved was never framed 
for something in its depths doth glow
too strange too restless too untamed
and women things that live and move
mined by the fever of the soul 
they seek to find in those they love
stern strength and promise of control
they ask not kindness gentle ways 
these they themselves have tried and known 
they ask a soul which never sways
with the blind gusts that shake their own
 love poems
i too have felt the load i bore
in a too strong emotions sway 
i too have wished no woman more
this starting feverish heart away
i too have longed for trenchant force
and will like a dividing spear 
have praised the keen unscrupulous course
which knows no doubt which feels no fear
but in the world i learnt what there
thou too will surely one day prove 
that will that energy though rare
are yet far far less rare than love
go then  till time and fate impress
this truth on thee be mine no more
they will for thou i feel not less
than i was destined to this lore
we school our manners act our parts 
but he who sees us through and through
knows that the bent of both our hearts
was to be gentle tranquil true
and though we wear out life alas
distracted as a homeless wind
in beating where we must not pass
in seeking what we shall not find 
love poems 
yet we shall one day gain life past
clear prospect oer our beings whole 
shall see ourselves and learn at last
our true affinities of soul
we shall not then deny a course
to every thought the mass ignore 
we shall not then call hardness force
nor lightness wisdom any more
then in the eternal fathers smile
our soothed encouraged souls will dare
to seem as free from pride and guile
as good as generous as they are
then we shall know our friends though much
will have been lost  the help in strife
the thousand sweet still joys of such
as hand in hand face earthly life 
though these be lost there will be yet
a sympathy august and pure 
ennobled by a vast regret
and by contrition sealed thrice sure
and we whose ways were unlike here
may then more neighboring courses ply 
may to each other be brought near
and greet across infinity
 love poems
how sweet unreached by earthly jars
my sister to maintain with thee
the hush among the shining stars
the calm upon the moonlit sea
how sweet to feel on the boon air
all our unquiet pulses cease 
to feel that nothing can impair
the gentleness the thirst for peace 
the gentleness too rudely hurled
on this wild earth of hate and fear 
the thirst for peace a raving world
would never let us satiate here
iv isolation to marguerite
we were apart  yet day by day
i bade my heart more constant be
i bade it keep the world away
and grow a home for only thee 
nor feared but thy love likewise grew
like mine each day more tried more true
the fault was grave i might have known
what far too soon alas i learned 
the heart can bind itself alone
and faith may oft be unreturned
selfswayed our feelings ebb and swell
thou lovst no more farewell farewell
love poems 
farewell and thou thou lonely heart
which never yet without remorse
even for a moment didst depart
from thy remote and sphered course
to haunt the place where passions reign 
back to thy solitude again 
back  with the conscious thrill of shame
which luna felt that summernight
flash through her pure immortal frame
when she forsook the starry height
to hang oer endymions sleep
upon the pinegrown latmian steep
yet she chaste queen had never proved
how vain a thing is mortal love
wandering in heaven far removed 
but thou hast long had place to prove
this truth to prove and make thine own
 thou hast been shalt be art alone
 or if not quite alone yet they
which touch thee are unmating things 
ocean and clouds and night and day 
lorn autumns and triumphant springs 
and life and others joy and pain
and love if love of happier men
of happier men  for they at least
have dreamed two human hearts might blend
in one and were through faith released
 love poems
from isolation without end
prolonged  nor knew although not less
alone than thou their loneliness
v to marguerite continued
yes  in the sea of life enisled
with echoing straits between us thrown
dotting the shoreless watery wild
we mortal millions live alone
the islands feel the enclasping flow
and then their endless bounds they know
but when the moon their hollows lights
and they are swept by balms of spring
and in their glens on starry nights
the nightingales divinely sing 
and lovely notes from shore to shore
across the sounds and channels pour 
oh  then a longing like despair
is to their farthest caverns sent 
for surely once they feel we were
parts of a single continent
now round us spreads the watery plain 
oh might our marges meet again
who ordered that their longings fire
should be as soon as kindled cooled
who renders vain their deep desire  
a god a god their severance ruled
and bade betwixt their shores to be
the unplumbed salt estranging sea
love poems 
vi absence
in this fair strangers eyes of gray
thine eyes my love  i see
i shiver  for the passing day
had borne me far from thee
this is the curse of life  that not
a nobler calmer train
of wiser thoughts and feelings blot
our passions from our brain 
but each day brings its petty dust
our soonchoked souls to fill 
and we forget because we must
and not because we will
i struggle towards the light  and ye
oncelongedfor storms of love
if with the light ye cannot be
i bear that ye remove
i struggle towards the light  but oh
while yet the night is chill
upon times barren stormy flow
stay with me marguerite still
vii the terrace at berne
composed ten years after the preceding
ten years  and to my waking eye
once more the roofs of berne appear 
the rocky banks the terrace high
the stream and do i linger here
 love poems
the clouds are on the oberland
the jungfrau snows look faint and far 
but bright are those green fields at hand
and through those fields comes down the aar
and from the blue twinlakes it comes
flows by the town the churchyard fair 
and neath the gardenwalk it hums
the house  and is my marguerite there 
ah  shall i see thee while a flush
of startled pleasure floods thy brow
quick through the oleanders brush
and clap thy hands and cry  thou
or hast thou long since wandered back
daughter of france  to france thy home 
and flitted down the flowery track
where feet like thine too lightly come 
doth riotous laughter now replace
thy smile and rouge with stony glare
thy cheeks soft hue and fluttering lace
the kerchief that inwound thy hair
or is it over art thou dead 
dead and no warning shiver ran
across my heart to say thy thread
of life was cut and closed thy span
love poems 
could from earths ways that figure slight
be lost and i not feel twas so 
of that fresh voice the gay delight
fail from earths air and i not know
or shall i find thee still but changed
but not the marguerite of thy prime 
with all thy being rearranged 
passed through the crucible of time 
with spirit vanished beauty waned
and hardly yet a glance a tone
a gesture  anything  retained
of all that was my marguerites own
i will not know for wherefore try
to things by mortal course that live
a shadowy durability
for which they were not meant to give 
like driftwood spars which meet and pass
upon the boundless oceanplain
so on the sea of life alas
man meets man  meets and quits again
i knew it when my life was young 
i feel it still now youth is oer
the mists are on the mountain hung
and marguerite i shall see no more

 love poems
evelyn hope
beautiful evelyn hope is dead
sit and watch by her side an hour
that is her bookshelf this her bed 
she plucked that piece of geraniumflower
beginning to die too in the glass 
little has yet been changed i think 
the shutters are shut no light may pass
save two long rays through the hinges chink
sixteen years old when she died
perhaps she had scarcely heard my name 
it was not her time to love  beside
her life had many a hope and aim
duties enough and little cares
and now was quiet now astir
till gods hand beckoned unawares 
and the sweet white brow is all of her
is it too late then evelyn hope
what your soul was pure and true
the good stars met in your horoscope
made you of spirit fire and dew 
and just because i was thrice as old
and our paths in the world diverged so wide
each was naught to each must i be told
we were fellow mortals naught beside 
love poems 
no indeed for god above
is great to grant as mighty to make
and creates the love to reward the love 
 claim you still for my own loves sake
delayed it may be for more lives yet
through worlds i shall traverse not a few 
much is to learn much to forget
ere the time be come for taking you
but the time will come  at last it will
when evelyn hope what meant i shall say
in the lower earth in the years long still
that body and soul so pure and gay 
why your hair was amber i shall divine
and your mouth of your own geraniums red 
and what you would do with me in fine
in the new life come in the old ones stead
i have lived i shall say so much since then
given up myself so many times
gained me the gains of various men
ransacked the ages spoiled the climes 
yet one thing one in my souls full scope
either i missed or itself missed me 
and i want and find you evelyn hope
what is the issue let us see
 love poems
vii
i loved you evelyn all the while
my heart seemed full as it could hold 
there was place and to spare for the frank young
smile and the red young mouth and the hairs young
gold
so hush  i will give you this leaf to keep 
see i shut it inside the sweet cold hand
there that is our secret  go to sleep 
you will wake and remember and understand robert browning
song
oh say not my love with that mortified air
that your springtime of pleasure is flown
nor bid me to maids that are younger repair
for those raptures that still are thine own
though april his temples may wreathe with the
vine
its tendrils in infancy curled
tis the ardor of august matures us the wine
whose lifeblood enlivens the world
though thy form that was fashioned as light as a
fays
has assumed a proportion more round
love poems 
and thy glance that was bright as a falcons at
gaze
looks soberly now on the ground 
enough after absence to meet me again
thy steps still with ecstasy move 
enough that those dear sober glances retain
for me the kind language of love

wisteria
how tenderly the twilight falls
about our dear homes flowery walls
upon the garden bowers
the breeze sighs over beds of bloom
my darling leave the dusky room
come out among the flowers
come forth my wife and stand with me
beneath our favorite chestnuttree 
the glory of our lawn 
look up dear heart in skies afar
how softly beams the evening star 
the garish sun is gone
how clearly from the coppice floats
the brown birds strain  its magic notes
of joy and sorrow blent
how sweetly from the southern wall
delightsome odors round us fall
the rich wisterias scent
 love poems
see darling in this tender gloom
the clusters of its purple bloom
peep out amid the green 
a comely summer robe it weaves
of sturdy twigs and tender leaves
with splendid blooms between
how rich and full a life must beat
in its green branches fair and sweet
it flowered in the spring 
and yet ere summer days are done
it spreadeth to the summer sun
a second blossoming
it seemeth unto us a type
of love springborn but summerripe
fullhearted love like ours
that sweetly smiled on lifes young spring
yet hath its fuller blossoming
in these maturer hours
our lives were like the springtime boughs
of this old tree which wreaths our house
with purple twice a year
no leafage green of worldly praise
or worldly wealth made glad our days
but lowly love was dear
ah darling on this summer night
our hearts brimful with deep delight
we bless god as we stand
love poems 
beneath his arch of twilight sky
at rest too glad to smile or sigh
the happiest in the land
our tree of life is strong and full
of leafage verdant beautiful
with blossoms in their prime
for love like fair wisteria flowers
brings with full hands to us and ours
a second blossomtime
all the year round
sonnet
yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace
and i be undeluded unbetrayed 
for if of our affections none find grace
in sight of heaven then wherefore hath god made
the world which we inhabit better plea
love cannot have than that in loving thee
glory to that eternal peace is paid
who such divinity to thee imparts
as hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts
his hope is treacherous only whose love dies
with beauty which is varying every hour 
but in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power
of outward change there blooms a deathless flower
that breathes on earth the air of paradise

 love poems
married lovers
come away the clouds are high
put the flashing needles by
many days are not to spare
or to waste my fairest fair
all is ready come today
for the nightingale her lay
when she findeth that the whole
of her love and all her soul
cannot forth of her sweet throat
sobs the while she draws her breath
and the bravery of her note
in a few days altereth
come ere she despond and see
in a silent ecstasy
chestnuts heave for hours and hours
all the glory of their flowers
to the melting blue above
that broods over them like love
leave the garden walls where blow
appleblossoms pink and low
ordered beds of tulips fine
seek the blossoms made divine
with a scent that is their soul
these are soulless bring the white
of thy gown to bathe in light
walls for narrow hearts the whole
earth is found and air and sea
not too wide for thee and me
love poems 
not too wide and yet thy face
gives the meaning of all space
and thine eyes with starbeams fraught 
hold the measure of all thought 
for of them my soul besought
and was shown a glimpse of thine 
a veiled vestal with divine
solace in sweet loves despair
for that life is brief as fair
who hath most he yearneth most
sure as seldom heretofore
somewhere of the gracious more
deepest joy the least shall boast
asking with newopened eyes
the remainder  that which lies
o so fair but not all conned 
o so near and yet beyond
come and in the woodland sit
seem a wonted part of it
then while moves the delicate air
and the glories of thy hair
little flickering sunrays strike
let me see what thou art like 
for great love enthralls me so
that in sooth i scarcely know
show me in a house all green
save for long gold wedges sheen
where the flies white sparks of fire
dart and hover and aspire
and the leaves airstirred on high
love poems
feel such joy they needs must sigh
and the untracked grass makes sweet
all fair flowers to touch thy feet
and the bees about them hum
all the world is waiting come 
jean ingelow
how many times
how many times do i love thee dear
tell me how many thoughts there be
in the atmosphere
of a newfalln year
whose white and sable hours appear
the latest flake of eternity 
so many times do i love thee dear
how many times do i love again
tell me how many beads there are
in a silver chain
of the evening rain
unravelled from the tumbling main
and threading the eye of a yellow star 
so many times do i love again thomas lovell beddoes
james lees wife
ah love but a day
and the world has changed
love poems 
the suns away
and the bird estranged 
the wind has dropped
and the skys deranged 
summer has stopped
look in my eyes i
wilt thou change too 
should i fear surprise 
shall i find aught new
in the old and dear
in the good and true
with the changing year
iii thou art a man
but i am thy love
for the lake its swan 
for the dell its dove 
and for thee  oh haste
me to bend above me to hold embraced
among the rocks
oh good gigantic smile o the brown old earth
this autumn morning how he sets his bones
to bask i the sun and thrusts out knees and feet
 love poems
for the ripple to run over in its mirth 
listening the while where on the heap of stones
the white breast of the sealark twitters sweet
that is the doctrine simple ancient true 
such is lifes trial as old earth smiles and knows
if you loved only what were worth your love
love were clear gain and wholly well for you 
make the low nature better by your throes
give earth yourself go up for gain above
along the beach
i will be quiet and talk with you
and reason why you are wrong
you wanted my love  is that much true 
and so i did love so i do 
what has come of it all along
i took you  how could i otherwise 
for a world to me and more 
for all love greatens and glorifies
till gods aglow to the loving eyes
in what was mere earth before
love poems 
iii
yes earth yes mere ignoble earth
now do i misstate mistake
do i wrong your weakness and call it worth
expect all harvest dread no dearth
seal my sense up for your sake 
o love love no love not so indeed
you were just weak earth i knew 
with much in you waste with many a weed
and plenty of passions run to seed
but a little good grain too
and such as you were i took you for mine 
did not you find me yours
to watch the olive and wait the vine
and wonder when rivers of oil and wine
would flow as the book assures 
well and if none of these good things came
what did the failure prove
the man was my whole world all the same
with his flowers to praise or his weeds to blame
and either or both to love
 love poems
vii
yet this turns now to a fault  there there
that i do love watch too long
and wait too well and weary and wear 
and tis all an old story and my despair
fit subject for some new song 
viii
 how the light light love he has wings to fly
at suspicion of a bond 
my wisdom has bidden your pleasure goodby
which will turn up next in a laughing eye
and why should you look beyond

the poets bridalday song
o mv loves like the steadfast sun
or streams that deepen as they run 
nor hoary hairs nor forty years
nor moments between sighs and tears
nor nights of thought nor days of pain
nor dreams of glory dreamed in vain
nor mirth nor sweetest song that flows
to sober joys and soften woes
can make my heart or fancy flee
one moment my sweet wife from thee
even while i muse i see thee sit
in maiden bloom and matron wit
love poems
fair gentle as when first i sued
ye seem but of sedater mood 
yet my heart leaps as fond for thee
as when beneath arbigland tree
we stayed and wooed and thought the moon
set on the sea an hour too soon 
or lingered mid the falling dew
when looks were fond and words were few
though i see smiling at thy feet
five sons and a fair daughter sweet
and time and care and birthtime woes
have dimmed thine eye and touched thy rose
to thee and thoughts of thee belong
whateer charms me in tale or song
when words descend like dews unsought
with gleams of deep enthusiast thought
and fancy in her heaven flies free
they come my love they come from thee
o when more thought we gave of old
to silver than some give to gold
twas sweet to sit and ponder oer
how we should deck our humble bower 
twas sweet to pull in hope with thee
the golden fruit of fortunes tree 
and sweeter still to choose and twine
a garland for that brow of time
a songwreath which may grace my jean
while rivers flow and woods grow green
 love poems
at times there come as come there ought
grave moments of sedater thought
when fortune frowns nor lends our night
one gleam of her inconstant light 
and hope that decks the peasants bower
shines like a rainbow through the shower
 then i see while seated nigh
a mothers heart shine in thine eye
and proud resolve and purpose meek
speak of thee more than words can speak
 think this wedded wife of mine
the best of all thats not divine allan cunningham
my lady singing
she whom this heart must ever hold most dear
this heart in happy bondage held so long
began to sing at first a gentle fear
rosied her countenance  for shes young
and he who loves her most of all was near 
but when at last her voice grew full and strong
o from their ambush sweet how rich and clear
bubbled the notes abroad  a rapturous throng
her little hands were sometimes flung apart
and sometimes palm to palm together prest
whilst wavelike blushes rising from her breast
kept time with that aerial melody
as muses to the sight  i standing nigh
received the falling fountain in my heart

madrigal
as i saw fair chloris walk alone
the feathered rain came softly down
as jove descending from his tower
to court her in a silver shower
the wanton snow flew to her breast
as little birds into their nest 
but overcome with whiteness there
for grief dissolved into a tear 
thence falling on her garments hem
to deck her froze into a gem

ive wandered east ive wandered west
through mony a weary way 
but never never can forget
the luve o lifes young day 
the fire thats blawn on beltane een
may weel be black gin yule 
but blacker fa awaits the heart
where first fond luve grows cule
 dear dear jeanie morrison
the thochts o bygane years
still fling their shadows ower my path
and blind my een wi tears 
they blind my een wi saut saut tears
and sair and sick i pine
as memory idly summons up
the blithe blinks o lang syne
twas then we luvit ilk ither weel
twas then we twa did part 
sweet time  sad time  twa bairns at scule
twa bairns and but ae heart
twas then we sat on ae laigh bink
to leir ilk ither lear 
and tones and looks and smiles were shed
remembered evermair
 wonder jeanie aften yet
when sitting on that bink
love poems 
cheek touchin cheek loof locked in loof
what our wee heads could think
when baith bent doun ower ae braid page
wi ae buik on our knee
thy lips were on thy lesson but
my lesson was in thee
o mind ye how we hung our heads
how cheeks brent red wi shame
wheneer the sculeweans laughin said
we cleeked thegither hame 
and mind ye o the saturdays
the scule then skailt at noon
when we ran off to speel the braes 
the broomy braes o june
my head rins round and round about
my heart flows like a sea
as one by one the thochts rush back
o sculetime and o thee
o mornin life o mornin luve
o lichtsome days and lang
when hinnied hopes around our hearts
like simmer blossoms sprang
o mind ye luve how aft we left
the deavin dinsome town
to wander by the green burnside
and hear its waters croon 
the simmer leaves hung ower our heads
the flowers burst round our feet
 love poems
and in the gloamin o the wood
the throssil whusslit sweet 
the throssil whusslit in the wood
the burn sang to the trees
and we with natures heart in tune
concerted harmonies 
and on the knowe abune the burn
for hours thegither sat
yon the silentness o joy till baith
wi very gladness grat
ay ay dear jeanie morrison
tears twinkled down your cheek
like dewbeads on a rose yet nane
had ony power to speak
that was a time a blessed time
when hearts were fresh and young
when freely gushed all feelings forth
unsyllabled  unsung
i marvel jeanie morrison
gin i hae been to thee
as closely twined wi earliest thochts
as ye hae been to me 
o tell me gin their music fills
thine ear as it does mine
o say gin eer your heart grows grit
wi dreamings o lang syne
love poems 
ive wandered east ive wandered west
ive born a weary lot 
but in my wanderings far or near
ye never were forgot
the fount that first burst frae this heart
still travels on its way 
and channels deeper as it rins
the luve o lifes young day
o dear dear jeanie morrison
since we were sindered young
ive never seen your face nor heard
the music o your tongue 
but i could hug all wretchedness
and happy could i die
did i but ken your heart still dreamed
o bygane days and me william motherwell
i met wi her i luved yestreen
i met wi her i luved yestreen
i met her wi a look o sorrow 
my leave i took o her for aye
a weddit bride shell be the morrow
she durst na gie ae smile to me
nor drap ae word o kindly feelin
yet down her cheeks the bitter tears
in monie a pearly bead were stealin
 love poems
i could na my lost luve upbraid
altho my dearest hopes were blighted
i could na say  yere fause to me   
tho to anither she was plighted
like suthfast friens whom death divides
in heaven to meet we silent parted 
nae voice had we our griefs to speak
we felt sae lone and brokenhearted
ill hie me frae my native ian
far frae thy blythesome banks o yarrow
waes me i canna bide to see
my winsume luve anithers marrow
ill hie me to a distant ian
wi downcast ee and lifesick bosom
a weary waste the warlds to me
sin i hae lost that bonnie blossom

a womans question
before i trust my fate to thee
or place my hand in thine
before i let thy future give
color and form to mine
before i peril all for thee question thy soul tonight
for me
love poems 
i break all slighter bonds nor feel
a shadow of regret 
is there one link within the past
that holds thy spirit yet
or is thy faith as clear and free as that which i can
pledge to thee 
does there within thy dimmest dreams
a possible future shine
wherein thy life could henceforth breathe
untouched unshared by mine
if so at any pain or cost o tell me before all is lost
look deeper still if thou canst feel
within thy inmost soul
that thou hast kept a portion back
while i have staked the whole 
let no false pity spare the blow but in true mercy
tell me so
is there within thy heart a need
that mine cannot fulfil 
one chord that any other hand
could better wake or still
speak now  lest at some future day my whole life
wither and decay
lives there within thy nature hid
the demonspirit change
shedding a passing glory still
on all things new and strange  
it may not be thy fault alone but shield my heart
against thy own
 love poems
couldst thou withdraw thy hand one day
and answer to my claim
that fate and that todays mistake 
not thou  had been to blame 
some soothe their conscience thus  but thou wilt
surely warn and save me now
nay answer not  i dare not hear
the words would come too late 
yet i would spare thee all remorse
so comfort thee my fate 
whatever on my heart may fall remember i would
risk it all 
adelaide anne procter
a womans answer
i will not let you say a womans part
must be to give exclave love alone 
dearest although i love you so my heart
answers a thousand claims beside your own
i love what do i not love earth and air
find space within my heart and myriad things
you would not deign to heed are cherished there
and vibrate on its very inmost strings
i love the summer with her ebb and flow
of light and warmth and music that have nurst
her tender buds to blossoms

and you know
it was in summer that i saw you first
songs of spring
love poems 
i love the winter dearly too

but then
i owe it so much  on a winters day
bleak cold and stormy you returned again
when you had been those weary months away
i love the stars like friends  so many nights
i gazed at them when you were far from me
till i grew blind with tears

those faroff lights
could watch you whom i longed in vain to see
i love the flowers  happy hours lie
shut up within their petals close and fast 
you have forgotten dear but they and i
keep every fragment of the golden past
i love too to be loved  all loving praise
seems like a crown upon my life to make
it better worth the giving and to raise
still nearer to your own the heart you take
i love all good and noble souls   i heard
one speak of you but lately and for days
only to think of it my soul was stirred
in the tender memory of such generous praise
i love all those who love you  all who owe
comfort to you  and i can find regret
even for those poorer hearts who once could know
and once could love you and can now forget
 love poems
well is my heart so narrow  i who spare
love for all these  do i not even hold
my favorite books in special tender care
and prize them as a miser does his gold
the poets that you used to read to me
while summer twilights faded in the sky 
but most of all i think aurora leigh
because because  do you remember why 
will you be jealous did you guess before
i loved so many things still you the best  
dearest remember that i love you more
o more a thousand times than all the rest 
adelaide anne procter
true or false
so you think you love me do you
well it may be so 
but there are many ways of loving
i have learnt to know
many ways and but one true way
which is very rare 
and the counterfeits look brightest
though they will not wear
yet they ring almost quite truly
last with care for long 
but in time must break may shiver
at a touch of wrong 
love poems 
having seen what looked most real
crumble into dust 
now i chose that test and trial
should precede my trust
i have seen a love demanding
time and hope and tears
chaining all the past exacting
bonds from future years 
mind and heart and joy and sorrow
claiming as its fee 
that was love of self and never
never love of me
i have seen a love forgetting
all above beyond
linking every dream and fancy
in a sweeter bond 
counting every hour worthless
which was cold or free  
that perhaps was  love of pleasure
but not love of me
i have seen a love whose patience
never turned aside
full of tender fond devices 
constant even when tried 
smallest boons were held as victories
drops that swelled the sea 
that i think was  love of power
but not love of me
love poems
i have seen a love disdaining
ease and pride and fame burning even its own white pinions
just to feed its flame 
reigning thus supreme triumphant
by the souls decree 
that was  love of love i fancy
but not love of me 
i have heard or dreamt it may be 
what love is when true 
how to test and how to try it
is the gift of few 
these few say or did i dream it
that true love abides in these very things but always
has a soul besides
lives among the false loves knowing
just their peace and strife 
bears the selfsame look but always
has an inner life only a true heart can find it
true as it is true only eyes as clear and tender
look it through and through
if it dies it will not perish
by times slow decay true love only grows they tell me
stronger day by day 
love poems h
pain has been its friend and comrade 
fate it can defy 
only by its own sword sometimes
love can choose to die
and its grave shall be more noble
and more sacred still
than a throne where one less worthy
reigns and rules at will
tell me then do you dare offer
this true love to me
 
neither you nor i can answer 
we will wait and see
adelaide anne procter
i saw thee weep
i saw thee weep the big bright tear
came oer that eye of blue 
and then methought it did appear
a violet dropping dew 
i saw thee smile  the sapphires blaze
beside thee ceased to shine 
it could not match the living rays
that filld that glance of thine
as clouds from yonder sun receive
a deep and yellow die
which scarce the shade of coming eve
 love poems
can banish from the sky
those smiles unto the moodiest mind
their own pure joy impart 
their sunshine leaves a glow behind
that lightens oer the heart
lord byron
origin of love
the  origin of love    ah why
that cruel question ask of me
when thou mayst read in many an eye
he starts to life on seeing thee
and shouldst thou seek his end to know 
my heart forebodes my fears foresee
hell linger long in silent woe 
but live  until i cease to be
lord byron
the dream
our life is twofold  sleep hath its own world
a boundary between the things misnamed
death and existence  sleep hath its own world
and a wide realm of wild reality
and dreams in their development have breath
and tears and tortures and the touch of joy
they leave a weight upon our waking thoughts
they take a weight from off our waking toils
love poems 
they do divide our being  they become
a portion of ourselves as of our time
and look like heralds of eternity 
they pass like spirits of the past  they speak
like sibyls of the future  they have power
the tyranny of pleasure and of pain 
they make us what we were not what they will
and shake us with the vision thats gone by
the dread of vanishd shadows  are they so 
is not the past all shadow  what are they 
creations of the mind
the mind can make
substance and people planets of its own
with beings brighter than have leen and give
a breath to forms which can outlive all flesh
i would recall a vision which i dreamd
perchance in sleep for in itself a thought
a slumbering thought is capable of years
and curdles a long life into one hour
i saw two beings in the hues of youth
standing upon a hill a gentle hill
green and of mild declivity the last
as twere the cape of a long ridge of such
save that there was no sea to lave its base
but a most living landscape and the wave
of woods and cornfields and the abodes of men
scatterd at intervals and wreathing smoke
arising from such rustic roofs  the hill
was crowned with a peculiar diadem
 love poems
of trees in circular array so fixd
not by the sport of nature but of man 
these two a maiden and a youth were there
gazing  the one on all that was beneath
fair as herself but the boy gazed on her 
and both were young and one was beautiful 
and both were young  yet not alike in youth
as the sweet moon on the horizons verge
the maid was on the eve of womanhood 
the boy had fewer summers but his heart
had far outgrown his years and to his eye
there was but one beloved face on earth
and that was shining on him  he had lookd
upon it till it could not pass away 
he had no breath no being but in hers 
she was his voice  he did not speak to her
but trembled on her words  she was his sight
for his eye followd hers and saw with hers
which colord all his objects  he had ceased
to live within himself she was his life
the ocean to the river of his thoughts
which terminated all  upon a tone
a touch of hers his blood would ebb and flow
and his cheek change tempestuously  his heart
unknowing of its cause of agony
but she in these fond feelings had no share 
her sighs were not for him  to her he was even as a brother  but no more  twas much
for brotherless she was save in the name
her infant friendship had bestowd on him 
herself the solitary scion left
love poems 
of a timehonord race  it was a name
 which pleased him and yet pleased him not and
time taught him a deep answer  when she loved
another  even now she loved another
and on the summit of that hill she stood
looking afar if yet her lovers steed
kept pace with her expectancy and flew
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
there was an ancient mansion and before
its walls there was a steed caparisond 
within an antique oratory stood
the boy of whom i spake   he was alone
and pale and pacing to and fro  anon
he sate him down and seized a pen and traced
words which i could not guess of then he leand
his bowd head on his hands and shook as twere
with a convulsion  then arose again
and with his teeth and quivering hands did tear
what he had written but he shed no tears
and he did calm himself and fix his brow
into a kind of quiet  as he paused
the lady of his love reenterd there 
she was serene and smiling then and yet
she knew she was by him beloved she knew
for quickly comes such knowledge that his heart
was darkend with her shadow and she saw
that he was wretched but she saw not all
 love poems
he rose and with a cold and gentle grasp
he took her hand  a moment oer his face
a tablet of unutterable thoughts
was traced and then it faded as it came 
he droppd the hand he held and with slow steps
retired but not as bidding her adieu
for they did part with mutual smiles  he passd
from out the massy gate of that old hall
and mounting on his steed he went his way 
and neer repassd that hoary threshold more
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
the boy was sprung to manhood  in the wilds
of fiery climes he made himself a home
and his soul drank their sunbeams  he was girt
with strange and dusky aspects  he was not
himself like what he had been  on the sea
and on the shore he was a wanderer 
there was a mass of many images
crowded like waves upon me but he was
a part of all  and in the last he lay
reposing from the noontide sultriness
couchd among fallen columns in the shade
of ruind walls that had survived the names
of those who reard them  by his sleeping side
stood camels grazing and some goodly steeds
were fastend near a fountain  and a man
clad in a flowing garb did watch the while
while many of his tribe slumberd around
love poems 
and they were canopied by the blue sky
so cloudless clear and purely beautiful
that god alone was to be seen in heaven
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
the lady of his love was wed with one
who did not love her better  in her home
a thousand leagues from his  her native home
she dwelt begirt with growing infancy
daughters and sons of beauty  but behold
upon her face there was the tint of grief
the settled shadow of an inward strife
and an unquiet drooping of the eye
as if its lid were charged with unshed tears
what could her grief be  she had all she loved
and he who had so loved her was not there
to trouble with bad hopes or evil wish
or ill repressd affliction her pure thoughts
what could her grief be   she had loved him
nor given him cause to deem himself beloved
nor could he be a part of that which preyd
upon her mind a spectre of the past
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
the wanderer was returnd  i saw him stand
before an altar with a gentle bride 
her face was fair but was not that which made
 love poems
the starlight of his boyhood  as he stood
even at the altar oer his brow there came
the selfsame aspect and the quivering shock
that in the antique oratory shook
his bosom in its solitude  and then 
as in that hour a moment oer his face
the tablet of unutterable thoughts
was traced and then it faded as it came
and he stood calm and quiet and he spoke
the fitting vows but heard not his own words
and all things reeld around him  he could see
not that which was nor that which should have
been
but the old mansion and the accustomd hall
and the rememberd chambers and the place
the day the hour the sunshine and the shade
all things pertaining to that place and hour
and her who was his destiny came back
and thrust themselves between him and the light 
what business had they there at such a time
vii
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
the lady of his love   oh she was changed
as by the sickness of the soul  her mind
had wanderd from its dwelling and her eyes
they had not their own lustre but the look
which is not of the earth  she was become
the queen of a fantastic realm  her thoughts
were combinations of disjointed things 
love poems 
and forms impalpable and unperceived
of others sight familiar were to hers
and this the world calls phrensy but the wise
have a far deeper madness and the glance
of melancholy is a fearful gift 
what is it but the telescope of truth 
which strips the distance of its phantasies
and brings life near in utter nakedness
making the cold reality too real
a change came oer the spirit of my dream
the wanderer was alone as heretofore
the beings which surrounded him were gone
or were at war with him  he was a mark
for blight and desolation compassd round
with hatred and contention  pain was mixd
in all which was served up to him until
like to the pontic monarch of old days
he fed on poisons and they had no power
but were a kind of nutriment he lived
through that which had been death to many men
and made him friends of mountains  with the stars
and the quick spirit of the universe
he held his dialogues  and they did teach
to him the magic of their mysteries 
to him the book of night was opend wide
and voices from the deep abyss revealed
a marvel and a secret  be it so
 love poems
my dream was past  it had no future change
it was of a strange order that the doom
of these two creatures should be thus traced out
almost like a reality  the one
to end in madness both in misery
lord byron
love
all thoughts all passions all delights
whatever stirs this mortal frame
all are but ministers of love
and feed his sacred flame
oft in my waking dreams do i
live oer again that happy hour
when midway on the mount i lay
beside the ruind tower
the moonshine stealing oer the scene
had blended with the lights of eve 
and she was there my hope my joy
my own dear genevieve
she leand against the armed man
the statue of the armed knight 
she stood and listend to my lay
amid the lingering light
love poems
few sorrows hath she of her own
my hope my joy my genevieve
she loves me best wheneer i sing
the songs that make her grieve
i playd a soft and doleful air
i sang an old and moving story 
an old rude song that suited well
that ruin wild and hoary
she listend with a flitting blush
with downcast eyes and modest grace 
for well she knew i could not choose
but gaze upon her face
i told her of the knight that wore
upon his shield a burning brand 
and that for ten long years he wood
the lady of the land
i told her how he pined  and ah 
the deep the low the pleading tone
with which i sang anothers love
interpreted my own
she listend with a flitting blush
with downcast eyes and modest grace 
and she forgave me that i gazed
too fondly on her face
 love poems
but when i told the cruel scorn
that crazed that bold and lovely knight
and that he crossd the mountainwoods
nor rested day nor night 
that sometimes from the savage den
and sometimes from the darksome shade
and sometimes starting up at once
in green and sunny glade
there came and lookd him in the face
an angel beautiful and bright 
and that he knew it was a fiend
this miserable knight
and that unknowing what he did
he leapd amid a murderous band
and saved from outrage worse than death
the lady of the land 
and how she wept and claspd his knees 
and how she tended him in vain 
and ever strove to expiate
the scorn that crazed his brain 
and that she nursed him in a cave
and how his madness went away
when on the yellow forestleaves
a dying man he lay 
love poems 
 his dying words  but when i reachd
that tenderest strain of all the ditty
my faltering voice and pausing harp
disturbed her soul with pity
all impulses of soul and sense
had thrilld my guileless genevieve 
the music and the doleful tale
the rich and balmy eve 
and hopes and fears that kindle hope
an undistinguishable throng
and gentle wishes long subdued
subdued and cherishd long
she wept with pity and delight
she blushd with love and virgin shame 
and like the murmur of a dream
i heard her breathe my name
her bosom heaved  she steppd aside
as conscious of my look she stept 
then suddenly with timorous eye
she fled to me and wept
she half enclosed me with her arms
she pressd me with a meek embrace 
and bending back her head lookd up
and gazed upon my face
 love poems
twas partly love and partly fear
and partly twas a bashful art
that i might rather feel than see
the swelling of her heart
i calmd her fears and she was calm
and told her love with virgin pride 
and so i won my genevieve
my bright and beauteous bride
s t coleridge
all for love
o talk not to me of a name great in story 
the days of our youth are the days of our glory 
and the myrtle and ivy of sweet twoandtwenty
are worth all your laurels though ever so plenty
what are garlands and crowns to the brow that is
wrinkled 
tis but as a dead flower with maydew besprinkled 
then away with all such from the head that is
hoary 
what care i for the wreaths that can only give glory
o fame if i eer took delight in thy praises
twas less for the sake of thy highsounding phrases
than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover
she thought that i was not unworthy to love her
love poems 
there chiefly i sought thee there only i found thee 
her glance was the best of the rays that surround
thee
when it sparkled oer aught that was bright in my
story
i knew it was love and i felt it was glory
lord byron
the lost love
she dwelt among the untrodden ways
beside the springs of dove 
a maid whom there were none to praise
and very few to love
a violet by a mossy stone
halfhidden from the eye
 fair as a star when only one
is shining in the sky
she lived unknown and few could know
when lucy ceased to be 
but she is in her grave and o
the difference to me
william wordsworth
shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate 
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summers lease hath all too short a date 
 love poems
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed 
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or natures changing course untrimmed 
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owst 
nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growst 
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
william shakespeare
she is not fair to outward view
as many maidens be 
her loveliness i never knew
until she smiled on me
o then i saw her eye was bright
a well of love a spring of light
but now her looks are coy and cold
to mine they neer reply
and yet i cease not to behold
the lovelight in her eye 
her very frowns are fairer far
than smiles of other maidens are
h coleridge
music when soft voices die
vibrates in thememory 
odors when sweet violets sicken
live within the sense they quicken
love poems 
rose leaves when the rose is dead
are heapd for the beloveds bed 
and so thy thoughts when thou art gone
love itself shall slumber on

the true beauty
he that loves a rosy cheek
or a coral lip admires
or from starlike eyes doth seek
fuel to maintain his fires 
as old time makes these decay
so his flames must waste away
but a smooth and steadfast mind
gentle thoughts and calm desires
hearts with equal love combined
kindle neverdying fires  
where these are not i despise
lovely cheeks or lips or eyes

sweet be not proud of those two eyes
which starlike sparkle in their skies 
nor be you proud that you can see
all hearts your captives  yours yet free 
 love poems
be you not proud of that rich hair
which wantons with the lovesick air 
whenas that ruby which you wear
sunk from the tip of your soft ear
will last to be a precious stone
when all your world of beautys gone

go lovely rose
tell her that wastes her time and me
that now she knows
when i resemble her to thee
how sweet and fair she seems to be
tell her thats young
and shuns to have her graces spied
that hadst thou sprung
in deserts where no men abide
thou must have uncommended died
small is the worth
of beauty from the light retired 
bid her come forth
suffer herself to be desired
and not blush so to be admired
then die that she
the common fate of all things rare
may read in thee 
how small a part of time they share
that are so wondrous sweet and fair

blind love
o me  what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight 
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright 
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
loves eye is not so true as all mens  no
how can it o how can loves eye be true
that is so vexd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view 
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
william shakespeare
where shall the lover rest
where shall the lover rest
whom the fates sever
from his true maidens breast
parted forever
where through groves deep and high
sounds the far billow
 love poems
where early violets die
under the willow
eleu loro
soft shall be his pillow
there through the summer day
cool streams are laving 
there while the tempests sway
scarce are boughs waving 
there thy rest shalt thou take
parted forever
never again to wake
never o never
eleu loro
never o never
where shall the traitor rest
he the deceiver
who could win maidens breast
ruin and leave her
in the lost battle
borne down by the flying
where mingles wars rattle
with groans of the dying 
eleu loro
there shall he be lying
her wing shall the eagle flap
oer the falsehearted 
his warm blood the wolf shall lap
ere life be parted 
love poems 
shame and dishonor sit
by his grave ever 
blessing shall hallow it
never o never

sir w scott
one word is too often profaned
for me to profane it
one feeling too falsely disdaind
for thee to disdain it
one hope is too like despair
for prudence to smother
and pity from thee more dear
than that from another
i can give not what men call love 
but wilt thou accept not
the worship the heart lifts above
and the heavens reject not 
the desire of the moth for the star
of the night for the morrow
the devotion to something afar
from the sphere of our sorrow

 love poems
a birthday
my heart is like a singing bird
whose nest is in a watered shoot 
my heart is like an apple tree
whose boughs are bent with thickest fruit 
my heart is like a rainbow shell
that paddles in a halcyon sea 
my heart is gladder than all these
because my love is come to me
raise me a dais of silk and down
hang it with vair and purple dyes
carve it in doves and pomegranates
and peacocks with a hundred eyes 
work it in gold and silver grapes
in leaves and silver fleursdelys
because the birthday of my life
is come my love is come to me

from the winters tale
what you do
still betters what is done when you speak
sweet
id have you do it ever  when you sing
id have you buy and sell so so give alms
pray so  and for the ordering of your affairs
love poems 
to sing them too  when you do dance i wish you
a wave o the sea that you might ever do
nothing but that  move still still so
and own no other function each your doing
so singular in each particular
crowns what you are doing in the present deed
that all your acts are queens
william shakesfeare
sonnets from the portuguese
go from me yet feel that i shall stand
henceforward in thy shadow nevermore
alone upon the threshold of my door
of individual life i shall command
the uses of my soul nor lift my hand
serenely in the sunshine as before
without the sense of that which i forbore
 
thy touch upon the palm the widest land
doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine
with pulses that beat double what i do
and what i dream include thee as the wine
must taste of its own grapes and when i sue
god for myself he hears that name of thine
and sees within my eyes the tears of two
if thou must love me let it be for nought
except for loves sake only do not say
 i love her for her smile

her look

her way
of speaking gently  for a trick of thought
 love poems
that falls in well with mine and certes brought
a sense of pleasant ease on such a day  
for these things in themselves beloved may
be changed or change for thee  and love
wrought
may be unwrought so neither love me for
thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry 
a creature might forget to weep who bore
thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby
but love me for loves sake that evermore
thou mayst love on through loves eternity
beloved my beloved when i think
that thou wast in the world a year ago
what time i sate alone here in the snow
and saw no footprint heard the silence sink
no moment at thy voice

but link by link
went counting all my chains as if that so
they never could fall off at any blow
struck by thy possible hand

why thus i drink
of lifes great cup of wonder wonderful
never to feel thee thrill the day or night
with personal act or speech  nor ever cull
some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
thou sawest growing atheists are as dull
who cannot guess gods presence out of sight
is it indeed so  if i lay here dead
wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine
and would the sun for thee more coldly shine
love poems 
because of gravedamps falling round my head 
i marvelled my beloved when i read
thy thought so in the letter i am thine 
but

so much to thee  can i pour thy wine
while my hands tremble then my soul instead
of dreams of death resumes lifes lower range
then love me love look on me

breathe on
as brighter ladies do not count it strange
for love to give up acres and degree
i yield the grave for thy sake and exchange
my near sweet view of heaven for earth with thee
thou comest all is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do
in the noonsun with souls that tremble through
their happy eyelids from an unaverred
yet prodigal inward joy behold i erred
in that last doubt and yet i cannot rue
the sin most but the occasion

that we two
should for a moment stand unministered
by a mutual presence ah keep near and close
thou dovelike help and when my fears would rise
with thy broad heart serenely interpose
brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
these thoughts which tremble when bereft of those
like callow birds left desert to the skies
if i leave all for thee wilt thou exchange
and be all to me shall i never miss
 love poems
hometalk and blessing and the common kiss
that comes to each in turn nor count it strange
when i look up to drop on a new range
of walls and floors

another home than this
nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is
filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
thats hardest if to conquer love has tried
to conquer grief tries more  as all things prove 
for grief indeed is love and grief beside
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
yet love me  wilt thou open thine heart wide
and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
because thou hast the power and ownst the grace
to look through and behind this mask of me
against which years have beat thus blanchingly
with their rains and behold my souls true face
the dim and weary witness of lifes race  
because thou hast the faith and love to see
through that same souls distracting lethargy
the patient angel waiting for a place
in the new heavens  because nor sin nor woe
nor gods infliction nor deaths neighborhood
nor all which others viewing turn to go
 
nor all which makes me tired of all selfviewed
 
nothing repels thee

dearest teach me so
to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
how do i love thee  let me count the ways
i love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my soul can reach when feeling out of sight
love poems 
for the ends of being and ideal grace
i love thee to the level of everydays
most quiet need by sun and candlelight
i love thee freely as men strive for right 
i love thee purely as they turn from praise
i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints  i love thee with the breath
smiles tears of all my life  and if god choose
i shall but love thee better after death

from the epithalamium
open the temple gates unto my love
open them wide that she may enter in
and all the posts adorn as doth behove
and all the pillars deck with garlands trim
for to receive this saint with honor due
that cometh in to you
with trembling steps and humble reverence
she cometh in before the almightys view 
of her ye virgins learn obedience
when so ye come into those holy places
to humble your proud faces 
bring her up to the high altar that she may
the sacred ceremonies there partake
the which do endless matrimony make 
and let the roaring organs loudly play
 love poems
the praises of the lord in lively notes 
the whiles with hollow throats
the choristers the joyous anthem sing
that all the woods may answer and their echo ring
behold whiles she before the altar stands
hearing the holy priest that to her speaks
and blesseth her with his two happy hands
how the red roses flush up in her cheeks
and the pure snow with goodly vermeil stain
like crimson dyed in grain 
that even the angels which continually
about the sacred altar do remain
forget their service and about her fly
oft peeping in her face that seems more fair
the more they on it stare
but her sad eyes still fastened on the ground
are governed with goodly modesty
that suffers not one look to glance awry
which may let in a little thought unsound
why blush ye love to give to me your hand
the pledge of all our band
sing ye sweet angels alleluia sing
that all the woods may answer and your echo ring

of its own bounty or my need
what happy moments did i count
blest was i then all bliss above
now for that consecrated fount
of murmuring sparkling living love
what have i  shall i dare to tell
a comfortless and hidden well
a well of love  it may be deep 
i trust it is and never dry
what matter if the waters sleep
in silence and obscurity
such change and at the very door
of my fond heart hath made me poor

to anthea
bid me to live and i will live
thy protestant to be 
or bid me love and i will give
a loving heart to thee
a heart as soft a heart as kind
a heart as sound and free
as in the whole world thou canst find
that heart ill give to thee
 love poems
bid that heart stay and it will stay
to honor thy decree 
or bid it languish quite away
and t shall do so for thee
bid me to weep and i will weep
while i have eyes to see
and having none yet i will keep
a heart to weep for thee
bid me despair and ill despair
under that cypress tree 
or bid me die and i will dare
een death to die for thee
thou art my life my love my heart
the very eyes of me
and hast command of every part
to live and die for thee

passages from paradise lost
under his forming hands a creature grew
manlike but different sex so lovely fair
that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
mean or in her summed up in her contained
and in her looks which from that time infused
sweetness into my heart unfelt before
and into all things from her air inspired
the spirit of love and amorous delight
love poems 
she disappeared and left me dark  i waked
to find her or forever to deplore
her loss and other pleasures all abjure 
when out of hope beheld her not far off
such as i saw her in my dreams adorned
with what all earth of heaven could bestow
to make her amiable on she came
led by her heavenly maker though unseen
and guided by his voice nor uninformed
of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites 
grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye
in every gesture dignity and love 
if death
consort with thee death is to me as life
so forcible within my heart i feel
the bond of nature draw me to my own
my own in thee for what thou art is mine 
our state cannot be severed we are one
one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
with thee to go
is to stay here  without thee here to stay
is to go hence unwilling  thou to me
art all things under heaven all places thou
who for my wilful crime art banished hence

 love poems
song
i prithee send me back my heart
since i cannot have thine
for if from yours you will not part
why then shouldst thou have mine
yet now i think ont let it lie 
to find it were in vain 
for thoust a thief in either eye
would steal it back again
why should two hearts in one breast lie
and yet not lodge together
o love  where is thy sympathy
if thus our breasts thou sever
but love is such a mystery
i cannot find it out 
for when i think im best resolved
i then am in most doubt
then farewell care and farewell woe
i will no longer pine 
for ill believe i have her heart
as much as she has mine sir john suckling

if love were what the rose is
and i were like the leaf
our lives would grow together
in sad or singing weather
love poems 
blown fields or flowerful closes
green pleasure or gray grief
if love were what the rose is
and i were like the leaf
if i were what the words are
and love were like the tune
with double sound and single
delight our lips would mingle
with kisses glad as birds are
that get sweet rain at noon 
if i were what the words are
and love were like the tune
if you were hie my darling
and i your love were death
wed shine and snow together
ere march made sweet the weather
with daffodil and starling
and hours of fruitful breath 
if you were life my darling
and i your love were death
if you were thrall to sorrow
and i were page to joy
wed play for lives and seasons
with loving looks and treasons
and tears of night and morrow
and laughs of maid and boy 
if you were thrall to sorrow
and i were page to joy
 love poems
if you were aprils lady
and i were lord in may
wed throw with leaves for hours
and draw for days with flowers
till day like night were shady
and night were bright like day 
if you were aprils lady
and i were lord in may
if you were queen of pleasure
and i were king of pain
wed hunt down love together
pluck out his flying feather
and teach his feet a measure
and find his mouth a rein 
if you were queen of pleasure
and i were king of pain

lines
unfelt unheard unseen
ive left my little queen
her languid arms in silver slumber lying
ah  through their nestling touch
who  who can tell how much
there is for madness  cruel or complying
those faery lids how sleek
those lips how moist  they speak
love poems 
in ripest quiet shadows of sweet sounds 
into my fancys ear
melting a burden dear
how love doth know no fulness and no bounds

if stars were really watching eyes
of angel armies in the skies
i should forget all watchers there
and only for your glances care
and if your eyes were really stars
with leagues that none can mete for bars
to keep me from their longedfor day
i could not feel more far away
gathered roses
only a bee made prisoner
caught in a gathered rose
was he not ware a flower so fair
for the first gatherer grows
only a heart made prisoner
going out free no more 
was he not ware a face so fair
must have been gathered before

the time ive lost in wooing
the time ive lost in wooing
in watching and pursuing
the light that lies
in womans eyes
has been my hearts undoing
love poems 
though wisdom oft has sought me
i scorned the lore she brought me
my only books
were womans looks
and follys all theyve taught me

faded leaves
the river
still glides the stream slow drops the boat
under the rustling poplars shade 
silent the swans beside us float 
none speaks none heeds  ah turn thy head
let those arch eyes now softly shine
that mocking mouth grow sweetly bland 
ah let them rest those eyes on mine
on mine let rest that lovely hand
my pentup tears oppress my brain
my heart is swoln with love unsaid
ah  let me weep and tell my pain
and on thy shoulder rest my head
before i die  before the soul
which now is mine must reattain
immunity from my control
and wander round the world again 
before this teased oerlabored heart
forever leaves its vain employ
dead to its deep habitual smart
and dead to hopes of future joy
love poems 
too late
each on his own strict line we move
and some find death ere they find love 
so far apart their lives are thrown
from the twin soul that halves their own
and sometimes by still harder fate
the lovers meet but meet too late
 thy heart is mine true true ah true
 then love thy hand  ah no  adieu 
longing
come to me in my dreams and then
by day i shall be well again 
for then the night will more than pay
the hopeless longing of the day
come as thou camst a thousand times
a messenger from radiant climes
and smile on thy new world and be
as kind to others as to me 
or as thou never camst in sooth
come now and let me dream it truth 
and part my hair and kiss my brow
and say my love  why sufferest thou 
 love poems
come to me in my dreams and then
by day i shall be well again
for then the night will more than pay
the hopeless longing of the day

she smiles and smiles and will not sigh
while we for hopeless passion die 
yet she could love those eyes declare
were but men nobler than they are
eagerly once her gracious ken
was turned upon the sons of men 
but light the serious visage grew 
she looked and smiled and saw them through
our petty souls our strutting wits
our labored puny passionfits 
ah may she scorn them still till we
scorn them as bitterly as she
yet show her once ye heavenly powers
one of some worthier race than ours
one for whose sake she once might prove
how deeply she who scorns can love
his eyes be like the starry lights
his voice like sounds of summer nights 
in all his lovely mien let pierce
the magic of the universe 
love poems 
and she to him will reach her hand
and gazing in his eyes will stand
and know her friend and weep for glee
and cry long long fve lookedfor thee
then will she weep  with smiles till then
coldly she mocks the sons of men 
till then her lovely eyes maintain
their pure unwavering deep disdain

sir launcelot and queen guine
vere
a fragment
like souls that balance joy and pain
with tears and smiles from heaven again
the maiden spring upon the plain
came in a sunlit fall of rain
in crystal vapor everywhere
blue isles of heaven laughd between
and far in forestdeeps unseen
the topmost elmtree gatherd green
from draughts of balmy air
sometimes the linnet piped his song 
sometimes the throstle whistled strong 
sometimes the sparhawk wheeld along
hushd all the groves from fear of wrong 
 love poems
by grassy capes with fuller sound
in curves the yellowing river ran
and drooping chestnutbuds began
to spread into the perfect fan
above the teeming ground
then in the boyhood of the year
sir launcelot and queen guinevere
rode thro the coverts of the deer
with blissful treble ringing clear
she seemd a part of joyous spring
a gown of grassgreen silk she wore
buckled with golden clasps before 
a lightgreen tuft of plumes she bore
closed in a golden ring
now on some twisted ivynet
now by some tinkling rivulet
in mosses mixt with violet
her creamwhite mule his pastern set 
and fleeter now she skimmd the plains
than she whose elfin prancer springs
by night to eery warblings
when all the glimmering moorland rings
with jingling bridlereins
 as she fled fast thro sun and shade
the happy winds upon her playd
blowing the ringlet from the braid 
she lookd so lovely as she swayd
the rein with dainty fingertips
love poems 
a man had given all other bliss
and all his worldly worth for this
to waste his whole heart in one kiss
upon her perfect lips

guinevere
but i was first of all the kings who drew
the knighthooderrant of this realm and all
the realms together under me their head
in that fair order of my table round
a glorious company the flower of men
to serve as model for the mighty world
and be the fair beginning of a time
i made them lay their hands in mine and swear
to reverence the king as if he were
their conscience and their conscience as their
king
to break the heathen and uphold the christ
to ride abroad redressing human wrongs
to speak no slander no nor listen to it
to lead sweet lives in purest chastity
to love one maiden only cleave to her
and worship her by years of noble deeds
until they won her for indeed i knew
of no more subtle master under heaven
than is the maiden passion for a maid
not only to keep down the base in man
but teach high thought and amiable words
 love poems
and courtliness and the desire of fame
and love of truth and all that makes a man      
 yet think not that i come to urge thy crimes
i did not come to curse thee guinevere
i whose vast pity almost make me die
to see thee laying there thy golden head
my pride in happier summers at my feet
the wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce
the doom of treason and the flaming death
when first i learnt thee hidden here is past
the pang which while i weighd thy heart with
too wholly true to dream untruth in thee
made my tears burn  is also past in part
and all is past the sin is sinnd and i
lo i forgive thee as eternal god
forgives  do thou for thine own soul the rest
but how to take last leave of all i loved
 golden hair with which i used to play
not knowing o imperialmoulded form
and beauty such as never woman wore
until it came a kingdoms curse with thee 
 cannot touch thy lips they are not mine
but lancelots  nay they never were the kings
i cannot take thy hand  that too is flesh
and in the flesh thou hast sinnd and mine own
flesh
here looking down on thine polluted cries
 i loathe thee   yet not less o guinevere
love poems 
for i was ever virgin save for thee
my love thro flesh hath wrought into my life
so far that my doom is i love thee still
let no man dream but that i love thee still
perchance and so thou purify thy soul
and so thou lean on our fair father christ
hereafter in that world where all are pure
we two may meet before high god and thou
wilt spring to me and claim me thine and know
i am thine husband  not a smaller soul
nor lancelot nor another leave me that
i charge thee my last hope now must i hence
thro the thick night i hear the trumpet blow 
they summon me their king to lead mine hosts
far down to that great battle in the west
where i must strike against the man they call
my sisters son  no kin of mine who leagues
with lords of the whitehorse heathen and
knights 
traitors and strike him dead and meet myself
death or i know not what mysterious doom
and thou remaining here wilt learn the event 
but hither shall i never come again
never lie by thy side see thee no more
farewell
o tennyson
altho thou maun never be mine
altho thou maun never be mine
altho even hope is denied
tis sweeter for thee despairing
than aught in the world beside jessy
 love poems
i mourn thro the gay gaudy day
as hopeless i muse on thy charms 
but welcome the dream o sweet slumber
for then i am lockt in thy arms jessy
i guess by the dear angel smile
i guess by the loverolling ee 
but why urge the tender confession
gainst fortunes cruel decree jessy

whom first we love you know we seldom wed
time rules us all and life indeed is not
the thing we planned it out ere hope was dead
and then we women cannot choose our lot
much must be borne which it is hard to bear 
much given away which it were sweet to keep
god help us all who need indeed his care
and yet i know the shepherd loves his sheep
my little boy begins to babble now
upon my knee his earliest infant prayer
he has his fathers eager eyes i know 
and they say too his mothers sunny hair
but when he sleeps and smiles upon my knee
and i can feel his light breath come and go
i think of one heaven help and pity me 
who loved me and whom i loved long ago 
love poems 
who might have been  ah what i dare not
think
we are all changed god judges for us best
god help us do our duty and not shrink
and trust in heaven humbly for the rest
but blame us women not if some appear
too cold at times  and some too gay and light
some griefs gnaw deep some woes are hard to
bear
who knows the past  and who can judge us right 
ah were we judged by what we might have been
and not by what we are too apt to fall
my little child  he sleeps and smiles between
these thoughts and me in heaven we shall know
all robert bulwer lytton
two loves
deep within my heart of hearts dear
bound with all its strings
two loves are together reigning
both are crowned like kings 
while my life still uncomplaining
rests beneath their wings
so they both will rule my heart dear

no sway can be deeper stronger
truer more complete 
growing as it lasts the longer
sweeter and more sweet
one all life and time transfigures 
piercing through and through
meaner things with magic splendor
old yet ever new 
this  so strong and yet so tender 
is

my love for you
should it fail  forgive my doubting
in this world of pain 
yet my other love would ever
steadfastly remain 
and i know that i could never
turn to that in vain
though its radiance may be fainter
yet its task is wide 
for it lives to comfort sorrows
strengthen calm and guide
and from trust and honor borrows
all its peace and pride
will you blame my dreaming even
if the first were flown 
ah i would not live without it
it is all your own 
and the other  can you doubt it  
yours and yours alone

king and slave
if in my soul dear
an omen should dwell
bidding me pause ere
i love thee too well 
if the whole circle
of noble and wise
with stern forebodings
between us should rise  
i will tell them dear
that love reigns  a king
where storms cannot reach him
and words cannot sting 
he counts it dishonor
his faith to recall 
he trusts  and forever
he gives and gives all 
i will tell thee dear
that love is  a slave
who dreads thought of freedom
as life dreads the grave 
and if doubt or peril
of change there may be
such fear would but drive him
still nearer to thee

 love poems
love
we cannot live except thus mutually
we alternate aware or unaware
the reflex act of life  and when we bear
our virtue onward most impulsively
most full of invocation and to be
most instantly compellant certes there
we live most life whoever breathes most air
and counts his dying years by sun and sea
but when a soul by choice and conscience doth
throw out her full force on another soul
the conscience and the concentration both
make mere life love for life in perfect whole
and aim consummated is love in sooth
as natures magnetheat rounds pole with pole

you have taken back the promise
that you spoke so long ago 
taken back the heart you gave me 
i must even let it go
where love once has breathed pride dieth 
so i struggled but in vain
first to keep the links together
then to piece the broken chain
love poems 
but it might not be  so freely
all your friendship i restore
and the heart that i had taken
as my own forevermore
no shade of reproach shall touch you
dread no more a claim from me 
but i will not have you fancy
that i count myself as free
i am bound by the old promise 
what can break that golden chain
not even the words that you have spoken
or the sharpness of my pain 
do you think because you fail me
and draw back your hand today
that from out the heart i gave you
my strong love can fade away 
it will live no eyes may see it 
in my soul it will lie deep
hidden from all  but i shall feel it
often stirring in its sleep
so remember that the friendship
which you now think poor and vain
will endure in hope and patience
till you ask for it again
perhaps in some long twilight hour
like those we have known of old
when past shadows gather round you
and your present friends grow cold
you may stretch your hands out towards me 
 love poems
ah you will  i know not when 
i shall nurse my love and keep it
faithfully for you till then

a love token
do you grieve no costly offering
to the lady you can make 
one there is and gifts less worthy
queens have stooped to take
take a heart of virgin silver
fashion it with heavy blows
cast it into loves hot furnace
when it fiercest glows
with pains sharpest point transfix it
and then carve in letters fair
tender dreams and quaint devices
fancies sweet and rare
set within it hopes blue sapphire
manychanging opal fears
bloodred rubystones of daring
mixed with pearly tears
and when you have wrought and labored
till the gift is all complete
you may humbly lay your offering
at the ladys feet
love poems 
should her mood perchance be gracious
with disdainful smiling pride
she will place it with the trinkets
glittering at her side adelaide anne procter
to mary in heaven
thou lingering star with lessning ray
that lovst to greet the early morn

my mary from my soul was torn
o mary dear departed shade where is thy place of blissful rest 
seest thou thy lover lowly laid 
hearst thou the groans that rend his breast
that sacred hour can i forget 
can i forget the hallowd grove
where by the winding ayr we met
to live one day of parting love 
eternity will not efface
those records dear of transports past 
thy image at our last embrace 
ah little thought we twas our last
ayr gurgling kissd his pebbled shore oerhung with wildwoods thickning green 
the fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar
twind amrous round the rapturd scene

the flowers sprang wanton to be prest
the birds sang love on evry spray
till too too soon the glowing west
proclaimd the speed of winged day
still oer these scenes my memry wakes
and fondly broods with miser care
time but the impression deeper makes
as streams their channels deeper wear
my mary dear departed shade
where is thy blissful place of rest
seest thou thy lover lowly laid
hearst thou the groans that rend his breast

loves omnipresence
were i as base as is the lowly plain
and you my love as high as heaven above
yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
ascend to heaven in honor of my love
were i as high as heaven above the plain
and you my love as humble and as low
as are the deepest bottoms of the main
wheresoer you were with you my love should go
were you the earth dear love and i the skies
my love should shine on you like to the sun
and look upon you with ten thousand eyes
till heaven waxd blind and till the world were done
wheresoer i am below or else above you
wheresoer you are my heart shall truly love you

thine own

two sapphires those dear eyes of thine
soft as the skies above thee 
thrice happy is the man to whom
those dear eyes say   i love thee
a diamond is thy heart that gleams
with rays of purest fire 
thrice happy is the man for whom
it glows with loves desire
two rubies are those lips of thine
unrivalled in fresh glory 
thrice happy is the man to whom
they whisper their love story
could i but find that lucky man
but meet that happy lover 
meet him alone in some dark wood 
his joy would soon be over

 love poems
what knight is this so weak and pale
though the locks are yet brown on his noble head
propped on pillows in his bed
gazing seaward for the light
of some ship that fights the gale
on this wild december night
over the sick mans feet is spread
a dark green forestdress 
a gold harp leans against the bed
ruddy in the fires light
i know him by his harp of gold
famous in arthurs court of old 
i know him by his forestdress 
the peerless hunter harper knight
tristram of lyoness
what lady is this whose silk attire
gleams so rich in the light of the fire 
the ringlets on her shoulders lying
in their flitting lustre vying
with the clasp of burnished gold
which her heavy robe doth hold
her looks are mild her fingers slight
as the driven snow are white 
but her cheeks are sunk and pale
is it that the bleak seagale
beating from the atlantic sea
on this coast of brittany
nips too keenly the sweet flower
is it that a deep fatigue
hath come on her a chilly fear
love poems 
passing all her youthful hour
spinning with her maidens here
listlessly through the windowbars
gazing seawards many a league
from her lonely shorebuilt tower
while the knights are at the wars
or perhaps has her young heart
felt already some deeper smart
of those that in secret the heartstrings rive
leaving her sunk and pale though fair 
who is this snowdrop by the sea 
i know her by her mildness rare
her snowwhite hands her golden hair 
i know her by her rich silk dress
and her fragile loveliness 
the sweetest christian soul alive
iseult of brittany
iseult of brittany but where
is that other iseult fair
that proud first iseult cornwalls queen
she whom tristrams ship of yore
from ireland to cornwall bore
to tyntagel to the side
of king marc to be his bride
she who as they voyaged quaffed
with tristram that spiced magic draught
which since then forever rolls
through their blood and binds their souls
working love but working teen 
there were two iseults who did sway
 love poems
each her hour of tristrams day 
but one possessed his waning time
the other his resplendent prime
behold her here the patient flower
who possessed his darker hour
iseult of the snowwhite hand
watches pale by tristrams bed
she is here who had his gloom 
where art thou who hadst his bloom
one such kiss as those of yore
might thy dying knight restore
does the lovedraught work no more
art thou cold or false or dead
iseult of ireland
loud howls the wind sharp patters the rain
and the knight sinks back on his pillows again 
he is weak with fever and pain
and his spirit is not clear
hark he mutters in his sleep
as he wanders far from here
changes place and time of year
and his closed eye doth sweep
oer some fair unwintry sea
not this fierce atlantic deep
while he mutters brokenly 
tristram
the calm sea shines loose hang the vessels sails 
before us are the sweet green fields of wales
love poems 
and overhead the cloudless sky of may
 ah  would  were in those green fields at play
not pent on shipboard this delicious day 
tristram i pray thee of thycourtesy
reach me my golden cup that stands by thee
but pledge vie in it first for courtesy
ha dost thou start are thy lips blanched like
mine
child tis no water this tis poisoned wine
iseult
 
ah sweet angels let him dream
keep his eyelids  let him seem
not this feverwasted wight
thinned and paled before his time
but the brilliant youthful knight
in the glory of his prime
sitting in the gilded barge
at thy side thou lovely charge
bending gayly oer thy hand
iseult of ireland
and she too that princess fair
if her bloom be now less rare
let her have her youth again
let her be as she was then
let her have her proud dark eyes
and her petulant quick replies 
let her sweep her dazzling hand
with its gesture of command
and shake back her raven hair
 love poems
with the old imperious air
as of old so let her be
that first iseult princess bright
chatting with her youthful knight
as he steers her oer the sea
quitting at her fathers will
the green isle where she was bred
and her bower in ireland
for the surgebeat cornish strand 
where the prince whom she must wed
dwells on loud tyntagels hill
high above the sounding sea
and that golden cup her mother
gave her that her future lord
gave her that king marc and she
might drink it on their marriageday
and forever love each other 
let her as she sits on board
 ah sweet saints unwittingly 
see it shine and take it up
and to tristram laughing say 
 sir tristram of thy courtesy
pledge me in my golden cup
let them drink it  let their hands
tremble and their cheeks be flame
as they feel the fatal bands
of a love they dare not name
with a wild delicious pain
twine about their hearts again
let the early summer be
once more round them and the sea
love poems 
blue and oer its mirror kind
let the breath of the maywind
wandering through their drooping sails
die on the green fields of wales 
let a dream like this restore
what his eye must see no more
tristram
chill blows the wind the pleasauncewalks are
drear 
madcap what jest was this to meet me here
were feet like those made for so wild a way
the southern winterparlor by my fay
had been the likeliest trystingplace today 
 tristram   nay nay  thou must not take my
hand 
tristram   sweet love   we are betrayed  outplanned
fly  save thyself save me  j dare not stay
one last kiss first     vain  to horse 
ah sweet saints his dream doth move
faster surely than it should
from the fever in his blood
all the springtime of his love
is already gone and past
and instead thereof is seen
its winter which endureth still 
tyntagel on its surgebeat hill
 love poems
the pleasauncewalks the weeping quet
the flying leaves the straining blast
and that long wild kiss  their last
and this rough decembernight
and his burning feverpain
mingle with his hurrying dream
till they rule it  till he seem
the pressed fugitive again
the lovedesperate banished knight
with a fire in his brain
flying oer the stormy main
 whither does he wander now
haply in his dreams the wind
wafts him here and lets him find
the lovely orphan child again
in her castle by the coast 
the youngest fairest chatelaine
that this realm of france can boast
our snowdrop by the atlantic sea 
iseult of brittany
and  for through the haggard air
the stained arms the matted hair
of that strangerknight illstarred
there gleamed something which recalled
the tristram who in better days
was launcelots guest at joyous gard 
welcomed here and here installed
tended of his fever here
haply he seems again to move
his young guardians heart with love in his exiled loneliness
love poems 
in his stately deep distress
without a word without a tear
 ah tis well he should retrace
his tranquil life in this lone place 
his gentle bearing at the side
of his timid youthful bride 
his long rambles by the shore
on winterevenings when the roar
of the near waves came sadly grand
through the dark up the drowned sand 
or his endless reveries
in the woods where the gleams play
on the grass under the trees
passing the long summers day
idle as a mossy stone
in the forest depths alone
the chase neglected and his hound
couched beside him on the ground
 ah  what troubles on his brow 
hither let him wander now
hither to the quiet hours
passed among these heaths of ours
by the gray atlantic sea 
hours if not of ecstasy
from violent anguish surely free
tristram
all red with blood the whirling river flows
the wide plain rings the dazed air throbs with
blows
 love poems
upon us are the chivalry of rome 
their spears are down their steeds are bathed in
foam
 up tristram up   men cry  thou moonstruck
knight
what foul fiend rides thee on into the fight
 above the din her voice is in my ears 
i see her form glide through the crossing spears 
iseult
 
ah  he wanders forth again 
we cannot keep him  now as then
theres a secret in his breast
which will never let him rest
these musing fits in the green wood
they cloud the brain they dull the blood
 his sword is sharp his horse is good 
beyond the mountains will he see
the famous towns of italy
and label with the blessed sign
the heathen saxons on the rhine
at arthurs side he fights once more
with the roman emperor
theres many a gay knight where he goes
will help him to forget his care 
the march the leaguer heavens blithe air
the neighing steeds the ringing blows 
sick pining comes not where these are
 ah  what boots it that the jest
lightens every other brow
love poems 
what that every other breast
dances as the trumpets blow
if ones own heart beats not light
on the waves of the tossed fight
if ones self cannot get free
from the clog of misery 
thy lovely youthful wife grows pale
watching by the salt seatide
with her children at her side
for the gleam of thy white sail
home tristram to thy halls again
to our lonely sea complain
to our forests tell thy pain
tristram
all round the forest sweeps off black in shade
but it is moonlight in the open glade 
and in the bottom of the glade shine clear
the forestchapel and the fountain near
 i think i have a fever in my blood 
come let me leave the shadow of this wood
ride down and bathe my hot brow in the flood
 mild shines the cold spring in the moons clear
light
god tis her face plays in the waters bright
 fair love she says  canst thou forget so soon
at this soft hour under this sweet moon   
iseult
 
ah poor soul if this be so
only death can balm thy woe
 love poems
the solitudes of the green wood
had no medicine for thy mood 
the rushing battle cleared thy blood
as little as did solitude
 ah his eyelids slowly break
their hot seals and let him wake 
what new change shall we now see
a happier worse it cannot be
tristram
is my page here come turn me to the fire
upon the windowpanes the moon shines bright 
the wind is down  but shell not come tonight
ah no she is asleep in cornwall now
far hence  her dreams are fair smooth is her brow
of me she recks not nor my vain desire
 i have had dreams i have had dreams my page
would take a score years from a strong mans age 
and with a blood like mine will leave i fear
scant leisure for a second messenger
my princess art thou there sweet tis too late
to bed and sleep my fever is gone by 
tonight my page shall keep me company
where do the children sleep kiss them for me
poor child thou art almost as pale as i 
this comes of nursing long and watching late
to bed goodnight
she left the gleamlit fireplace
she came to the bedside 
love poems 
she took his hands in hers her tears
down on her slender fingers rained
she raised her eyes upon his face
not with a look of wounded pride
a look as if the heart complained 
her look was like a sad embrace 
the gaze of one who can divine
a grief and sympathize
sweet flower thy childrens eyes
are not more innocent than thine
but they sleep in sheltered rest
like helpless babes in the warm nest
on the castles southern side 
where feebly comes the mournful roar
of buffeting wind and surging tide
through many a room and corridor
 full on their window the moons ray
makes their chamber as bright as day
it shines upon the blank white walls
and on the snowy pillow falls
and on two angelheads doth play
turned to each other  the eyes closed
the lashes on the cheeks reposed
round each sweet brow the cap closeset
hardly lets peep the golden hair 
through the softopened lips the air
scarcely moves the coverlet
one little wandering arm is thrown
at random on the counterpane
and often the fingers close in haste
 love poems
as if their babyowner chased
the butterflies again
this stir they have and this alone 
but else they are so still
 ah tired madcaps  you lie still 
but were you at the window now
to look forth on the fairy sight
of your illumined haunts by night
to see the parkglades where you play
far lovelier than they are by day
to see the sparkle on the eaves
and upon every giantbough
of those old oaks whose wet red leaves
are jewelled with bright drops of rain 
how would your voices run again
and far beyond the sparkling trees
of the castlepark one sees
the bare heaths spreading clear as day
moor behind moor far far away
into the heart of brittany
and here and there locked by the land
long inlets of smooth glittering sea
and many a stretch of watery sand
all shining in the white moonbeams
but you see fairer in your dreams
what voices are these on the clear night air
what lights in the court what steps on the stair
love poems 
istult of ireland
tristram
raise the light my page that i may see her 
thou art come at last then haughty queen
long ive waited long ive fought my fever
late thou comest cruel thou hast been
iseult
blame me not poor sufferer that i tarried 
bound i was i could not break the band
chide not with the past but feel the present 
i am here we meet i hold thy hand
tristram
thou art come indeed  thou hast rejoined me 
thou hast dared it  but too late to save
fear not now that men should tax thine honor
i am dying build thou mayst my grave
iseult
tristram ah for love of heaven speak kindly
what i hear these bitter words from thee
sick with grief i am and faint with travel 
take my hand  dear tristram look on me
 love poems
tristram
i forgot thou comest from thy voyage 
yes the spray is on thy cloak and hair
but thy dark eyes are not dimmed proud iseult
and thy beauty never was more fair
ah harsh flatterer let alone my beauty
i like thee have left my youth afar
take my hand and touch these wasted fingers 
see my cheek and lips how white they are 
tristram
thou art paler but thy sweet charm iseult
would not fade with the dull years away
ah how fair thou standest in the moonlight
i forgive thee iseult thou wilt stay
fear me not i will be always with thee 
i will watch thee tend thee soothe thy pain 
sing thee tales of true longparted lovers
joined at evening of their days again
tristram
no thou shalt not speak i should be finding
something altered in thy courtly tone
sit  sit by me i will think weve lived so
in the green wood all our lives alone
love poems 
iseult
altered tristram not in courts believe me
love like mine is altered in the breast 
courtly life is light and cannot reach it 
ah it lives because so deepsuppressed
what thou thinkst men speak in courtly cham
bers
words by which the wretched are consoled
what thou thinkst this aching brow was cooler
circled tristram by a band of gold
royal state with marc my deepwronged hus
band 
that was bliss to make my sorrows flee
silken courtiers whispering honeyed nothings 
those were friends to make me false to thee
ah  on which if both our lots were balanced
was indeed the heaviest burden thrown 
thee a pining exile in thy forest
me a smiling queen upon my throne
vain and strange debate where both have suffered
both have passed a youth repressed and sad
both have brought their anxious day to evening
and have now short space for being glad
joined we are henceforth  nor will thy people
nor thy younger iseult take it ill
that a former rival shares her office
when she sets her humbled pale and still
 love poems
i a faded watcher by thy pillow
i a statue on thy chapelfloor
poured in prayer before the virginmother
rouse no anger make no rivals more
she will cry  is this the foe i dreaded 
this his idol this that royal bride
ah an hour of health would purge his eyesight
stay pale queen forever by my side
hush no words that smile i see forgives me
i am now thy nurse i bid thee sleep
close thine eyes  this flooding moonlight blinds
them
nay alls well again thou must not weep
tristram
i am happy yet i feel theres something
swells my heart and takes my breath away
through a mist i see thee  near  come nearer
bend  bend down  i yet have much to say
iseult
heaven his head sinks back upon the pillow 
tristram tristram let thy heart not fail
call on god and on the holy angels
what love courage christ he is so pale
tristram
hush tis vain  i feel my end approaching
this is what my mother said should be
when the fierce pains took her in the forest
the deep draughts of death in bearing me
love poems 
 son she said  thy name shall be of sorrow 
tristram art thou called for my deaths sake
so she said and died in the drear forest
grief since then his home with me doth make
i am dying start not nor look wildly
me thy living friend thou canst not save
but since living we were ununited
go not far o iseult from my grave
close mine eyes then seek the princess iseult 
speak her fair she is of royal blood
say i charged her that thou stay beside me 
she will grant it she is kind and good
now to sail the seas of death i leave thee 
one last kiss upon the living shore
tristram tristram stay  receive me with thee
iseult leaves thee tristram nevermore
you see them clear  the moon shines bright
slow slow and softly where she stood
she sinks upon the ground  her hood
had fallen back her arms outspread
still hold her lovers hands  her head
is bowed halfburied on the bed
oer the blanched sheet her raven hair
lies in disordered streams  and there
s love poems
strung like white stars the pearls still are 
and the golden bracelets heavy and rare
flash on her white arms still 
the very same which yesternight
flashed in the silver sconces light
when the feast was gay and the laughter loud
in tyntagels palace proud
but then they decked a restless ghost
with hotflushed cheeks and brilliant eyes
and quivering lips on which the tide
of courtly speech abruptly died
and a glance which over the crowded floor
the dancers and the festive host
flew ever to the door 
that the knights eyed her in surprise
and the dames whispered scoffingly 
 her moods good lack they pass like showers
but yesternight and she would be
as pale and still as withered flowers 
and now tonight she laughs and speaks
and has a color in her cheeks
christ keep us from such fantasy 
yes now the longing is oerpast
which dogged by fear and fought by shame
shook her weak bosom day and night
consumed her beauty like a flame
and dimmed it like the desertblast
and though the curtains hide her face
yet were it lifted to the light
the sweet expression of her brow
love poems 
would charm the gazer till his thought
erased the ravages of time
filled up the hollow cheek and brought
a freshness back as of her prime 
so healing is her quiet now 
so perfectly the lines express
a tranquil settled loveliness
her younger rivals purest grace
the air of the decembernight
steals coldly around the chamber bright
where those lifeless lovers be
swinging with it in the light
flaps the ghostlike tapestry
and on the arras wrought you see
a stately huntsman clad in green
and round him a fresh forestscene
on that clear forestknoll he stays
with his pack round him and delays
he stares and stares with troubled face
at this huge gleamlit fireplace
at that bright ironfigured door
and those blown rushes on the floor
he gazes down into the room
with heated cheeks and flurried air
and to himself he seems to say 
 what place is this and who are they 
who is that kneeling lady fair 
and on his pillows that pale knight
who seems of marble on a tomb 
how comes it here this chamber bright
 love poems
through whose mullioned windows clear
the castlecourt all wet with rain
the drawbridge and the moat appear
and then the beach and marked with spray
the sunken reefs andfar away
the unquiet bright atlantic plain 
 what  has some glamour made me sleep
and sent me with my dogs to sweep
by night with boisterous buglepeal
through some old seaside knightly hall
not in thefree green wood at all
that knights asleep and at her prayer
that lady by the bed doth kneel 
then hush thou boisterous buglepeal i
 the wild boar rustles in his lair 
the fierce hounds snuff the tainted air 
but lord and hounds keep rooted there
cheer cheer thy dogs into the brake
o hunter and without a fear
thy goldentasselled bugle blow
and through the glades thy pastime take 
for thou wilt rouse no sleepers here
for these thou seest are unmoved 
cold cold as those who lived and loved
a thousand years ago
love poems 
iii
lesettlt of brtttang
a year had flown and oer the sea away
in cornwall tristram and queen iseult lay 
in king marcs chapel in tyntagel old 
there in a ship they bore those lovers cold
the young surviving iseult one bright day
had wandered forth her children were at play
in a green circular hollow in the heath
which borders the seashore  a country path
creeps over it from the tilled fields behind
the hollows grassy banks are softinclined 
and to one standing on them far and near
the lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear
over the waste the cirque of open ground
is light and green  the heather which all round
creeps thickly grows not here  but the pale grass
is strewn with rocks and many a shivered mass
of veined whitegleaming quartz and here and there
dotted with hollytrees and juniper
in the smooth centre of the opening stood
three hollies side by side and made a screen
warm with the wintersun of burnished green
with scarlet berries gemmed the fellfares food
under the glittering hollies iseult stands
watching her children play  their little hands
are busy gathering spars of quartz and streams
 love poems
of stagshorn for their hats  anon with screams
of mad delight they drop their spoils and bound
among the hollyclumps and broken ground
racing full speed and startling in their rush
the fellfares and the speckled misselthrush
out of their glossy coverts  but when now
their cheeks were flushed and over each hot brow
under the feathered hats of the sweet pair
in blinding masses showered the golden hair
then iseult called them to her and the three
clustered under the hollyscreen and she
told them an oldworld breton history
warm in their mantles wrapped the three stood
there
under the hollies in the clear still air 
mantles with those rich furs deep glistering
which venice ships do from swart egypt bring
long they stayed still then pacing at their ease
moved up and down under the glossy trees 
but still as they pursued their warm dry road
from iseults lips the unbroken story flowed
and still the children listened their blue eyes
fixed on their mothers face in wide surprise
nor did their looks stray once to the seaside
nor to the brown heaths round them bright and
wide
nor to the snow which though twas all away
from the open heath still by the hedgerows lay
nor to the shining seafowl that with screams
bore up from where the bright atlantic gleams
love poems 
swooping to landward  nor to where quite clear
the fellfares settled on the thickets near
and they would still have listened till dark night
came keen and chill down on the heather bright 
but when the red glow on the sea grew cold
and the gray turrets of the castle old
looked sternly through the frosty eveningair
then iseult took by the hand those children fair
and brought her tale to an end and found the path
and led them home over the darkening heath
and is she happy does she see unmoved
the days in which she might have lived and loved
slip without bringing bliss slowly away
one after one tomorrow like today
joy has not found her yet nor ever will 
is it this thought which makes her mien so still
her features so fatigued her eyes though sweet
so sunk so rarely lifted save to meet
her childrens  she moves slow  her voice alone
hath yet an infantine and silver tone
but even that comes languidly  in truth
she seems one dying in a mask of youth
and now she will go home and softly lay
her laughing children in their beds and play
a while with them before they sleep  and then
shell light her silver lamp which fishermen
dragging their nets through the rough waves afar
along this iron coast know like a star 
and take her broideryframe and there shell sit
hour after hour her gold curls sweeping it 
lifting her softbent head only to mind
 love poems
her children or to listen to the wind
and when the clock peals midnight she will move
her work away and let her ringers rove
across the shaggy brows of tristrams hound
who lies guarding her feet along the ground 
or else she will fall musing her blue eyes
fixed her slight hands clasped on her lap  then
rise
and at her priedieu kneel until she have told
her rosarybeads of ebony tipped with gold 
then to her soft sleep  and tomorrowll be
todays exact repeated effigy
yes it is lonely for her in her hall
the children and the grayhaired seneschal
her women and sir tristrams aged hound
are there the sole companions to be found
but these she loves  and noisier life than this
she would find ill to bear weak as she is
she has her children too and night and day
is with them  and the wide heaths where they play
the hollies and the cliff and the seashore
the sand the seabirds and the distant sails
these are to her dear as to them  the tales
with which this day the children she beguiled
she gleaned from breton grandames when a child
in every hut along this seacoast wild
she herself loves them still and when they are told
can forget all to hear them as of old
dear saints it is not sorrow as i hear
not suffering which shuts up eye and ear
love poems s
to all that has delighted them before
and lets us be what we were once no more
no  we may suffer deeply yet retain
power to be moved and soothed for all our pain
by what of old pleased us and will again
no  tis the gradual furnace of the world
in whose hot air our spirits are upcurled
until they crumble or else grow like steel
which kills in us the bloom the youth the spring
which leaves the fierce necessity to feel
but takes away the power  this can avail
by drying up our joy in everything
to make our former pleasures all seem stale
this or some tyrannous single thought some fit
of passion which subdues our souls to it
till for its sake alone we live and move 
call it ambition or remorse or love 
this too can change us wholly and make seem
all which we did before shadow and dream
and yet i swear it angers me to see
how this fool passion gulls men potently 
being in truth but a diseased unrest
and an unnatural overheat at best
how they are full of languor and distress
not having it  which when they do possess
they straightway are burnt up with fume and care
and spend their lives in posting here and there
where this plague drives them  and have little ease
are furious with themselves and hard to please
like that bald caesar the famed roman wight
who wept at reading of a grecian knight
 love poems
who made a name at younger years than he 
or that renowned mirror of chivalry
prince alexander philips peerless son
who carried the great war from macedon
into the soudans realm and thundered on
to die at thirtyfive in babylon
what tale did iseult to the children say
under the hollies that bright winters day
she told them of the fairyhaunted land
away the other side of brittany
beyond the heaths edged by the lonely sea 
of the deep forestglades of broceliande
through whose green boughs the golden sunshine
creeps
where merlin by the enchanted thorntree sleeps
for here he came with the fay vivian
one april when the warm days first began
he was on foot and that false fay his friend
on her white palfrey here he met his end
in these lone sylvan glades that aprilday
this tale of merlin and the lovely fay
was the one iseult chose and she brought clear
before the childrens fancy him and her
blowing between the stems the forestair
had loosened the brown locks of vivians hair
which played on her flushed cheek and her blue
eyes
sparkled with mocking glee and exercise
love poems 
her palfreys flanks were mired and bathed in sweat
for they had travelled far and not stopped yet
a brier in that tangled wilderness
had scored her white right hand which she allows
to rest ungloved on her green ridingdress 
the other warded off the drooping boughs
but still she chatted on with her blue eyes
fixed full on merlins face her stately prize
her havior had the mornings fresh clear grace
the spirit of the woods was in her face 
she looked so witching fair that learned wight
forgot his craft and his best wits took flight
and he grew fond and eager to obey
his mistress use her empire as she may
they came to where the brushwood ceased and day
peered twixt the stems  and the ground broke away
in a sloped sward down to a brawling brook
and up as high as where they stood to look
on the brooks farther side was clear but then
the underwood and trees began again
this open glen was studded thick with thorns
then white with blossom  and you saw the horns
through last years fern of the shy fallowdeer
who come at noon down to the water here
you saw the brighteyed squirrels dart along
under the thorns on the green sward  and strong
the blackbird whistled from the dingles near
and the weird chipping of the woodpecker
rang lonelily and sharp  the sky was fair
and a fresh breath of spring stirred everywhere
s love poems
merlin and vivian stopped on the slopes brow
to gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough
which glistening plays all round them lone and
mild
as if to itself the quiet forest smiled
upon the browtop grew a thorn and here
the grass was dry and mossed and you saw clear
across the hollow  white anemones
starred the cool turf and clumps of primroses
ran out from the dark underwood behind
no fairer restingplace a man could find 
 here let us halt said merlin then  and she
nodded and tied her palfrey to a tree
they sate them down together and a sleep
fell upon merlin more like death so deep
her finger on her lips then vivian rose
and from her brownlocked head the wimple throws
and takes it in her hand and waves it over
the blossomed thorntree and her sleeping lover
nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round
and made a little plot of magic ground
and in that daisied circle as men say
is merlin prisoner till the judgmentday 
but she herself whither she will can rove 
for she was passing weary of his love
matthew arnold
once in the backyard she was once like me
she was once like me
twice when i killed them they were once at peace
they were once like me
hold to your gun man and put off all your peace
put off all the beats
paid a full of these
i wait for it but someones once like me
she was once like me
i once was better i put off all my grief
i put off all my grief
and so i go to hell i wait for it but someones left me creased
and someones left me creased
all the trees of the field will clap their hands
if i am alive this time next year
will i have arrived in time to share
and mine is about as good this far
and im still applied to what you are
and i am joining all my thoughts to you
and im preparing every part for you
and i heard from the trees a great parade
and i heard from the hills a band was made
and will i be invited to the sound
and will i be a part of what youve made
and i am throwing all my thoughts away
and im destroying every bet ive made
and i am joining all my thoughts to you
and im preparing every part for you
to be alone with you
id swim across lake michigan
id sell my shoes
id give my body to be back again
in the rest of the room
to be alone with you
to be alone with you
to be alone with you
to be alone with you
you gave your body to the lonely
they took your clothes
you gave up a wife and a family
you gave your ghost
to be alone with me
to be alone with me
to be alone with me
you went up on a tree
to be alone with me you went up on a tree
ive never known a man who loved me
abraham
i was the best man in a size too small
you were my best friend going at it all
and what if i put off my inheritance
where is the best man all arise us all in peace
i still know you
and i still like you the best man
and i still owe you
everything rises going at it all
all the surprises in a size too small
and what if i told you i was still in love with this
would you surprise us in a size for all of me
i still know you
and i still like you the best man
i still know you the best man
i still owe you
so faithful so few
so pardon and done
and when we receive
we give a change at last
and when we are dead we all have wings
we wont need legs to stand
and when we receive
to see a change at last
our stepmom we did everything to hate her 
she took us down to the edge of decatur 
we saw the lion and the kangaroo take her 
down to the river where they caught a wild alligator 
sangamon river it overflowed 
it caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator 
civil war skeletons in their graves
they came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator 
the sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
we go riding on the abolition grain train
stephen a douglas was a great debater
but abraham lincoln was the great emancipator 
chickenmobile with your rooster tail
i had my fill and i know how bad it feels
stay awake and watch for the data
no small caterpillar go congratulate her
denominator go decatur go decatur
its the great i am 
abominate her go decatur why did we hate her 
its the great i am 
denominator go decatur anticipate her 
its the great i am 
appreciate her appreciate her
stand up and thank her
stand up and thank her
its the great i am
stand up and thank her
its the great i am
stand up and thank her
its the great i am
stand up and thank her
oh to see without my eyes
the first time that you kissed me
boundless by the time i cried
i built your walls around me
white noise what an awful sound
fumbling by rogue river
feel my feet above the ground
hand of god deliver me
oh woah woe is me
the first time that you touched me
oh will wonders ever cease
blessed be the mystery of love
lord i no longer believe
drowned in living waters
cursed by the love that i received
from my brothers daughter
like hephaestion who died
alexanders lover
now my riverbed has dried
shall i find no other
i have loved you for the last time
is it a video is it a video
i have touched you for the last time
is it a video is it a video
for the love for laughter i flew up to your arms
is it a video is it a video
for the love for laughter i flew up to your arms
is it a video is it a video is it a video
carrie and lowell
carrie and lowell
summertime long ago
like a dead horse
meadowlark drive your arrow
carry me home
rosie has turned to sorrow
head on the floorboards
drunk as a horsefly
climb on my mattress pad
twist my arm
under the pear tree
shadows and light conspiring
covered bridge i scream
cottage grove shade invite me
i will bow down
lord of the ancient waters
in the backyard
carrie surprised me
erebus on her back
like a charm
suppose the world was not informed by real estate or power lines
the hidden river of my life pursued by love
the whispering stone the valley ford the candy corn the spirit finds
abuse has left me on my side a single stone
im a walker im a dreamer
treehouse greeter pentacostal preacher
im a rocker yeah im a schemer
compost preacher pioneer believer
a small betrayal a simple thought to shrug it off unoccupied
the precious lake the riverbed the rising tide
the sad surprise the day of flags the flooding fox the clever chime
awake my soul awake my heart and you will find
shall we beat this or celebrate it
youre not the one to talk things through
you checked your texts while i masturbated
manelich i feel so used
found myself on spencers butte
traced your shadow with my shoe
empty outline changed my view
now all of me thinks less of you
on the sheet i see your horizon
all of me pressed onto you
but in this light you look like poseidon
im just a ghost you walk right through
saw myself on spencers butte all of me wants all of you
landscape changed my point of view all of me wants all of you
revelation may come true all of me wants all of you
now all of me thinks less of you all of me wants all of you
all of me wants all of you repeat
are we to speak first day of the week
stumbling words at the bar
beauty blue eyes my order of fries
long island kindness and wine
beloved of john i get it all wrong
i read you for some kind of poem
covered in lines the fossils i find
have they no life of their own
so can we pretend sweetly
before the mystery ends
i am a man with a heart that offends
with its lonely and greedy demands
theres only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking im dead
such a waste your beautiful face
stumbling carpet arise
go follow your gem your white feathered friend
icarus point to the sun
if history speaks of two baby teeth
im painting the hills blue and red
they said beware lord hear my prayer
ive wasted my throes on your head
so can we be friends sweetly
before the mystery ends
i love you more than the world can contain
in its lonely and ramshackle head
theres only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking im dead
im holding mcarrie and lowell
such a long time ago
like a dead horse
meadowlark drive your arrow
season of hope after the flood
valentine spurn my sorrow
head on the floorboards covered in blood
drunk as a horsefly
climb on the mattress pad
twist my arm
under the pear tree
shadows and light conspiring
covered bridge i scream
cottage grove shade invite me
i will bow down didos lament
lord of the ancient waters
from the backyard as far as she went
carrie surprised me
erebus on my back
my lucky charm
the only thing that keeps me from driving this car
halflight jack knife into the canyon at night
signs and wonders perseus aligned with the skull
slain medusa pegasus alight from us all
do i care if i survive this bury the dead where theyre found
in a veil of great surprises i wonder did you love me at all
the only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
cross hatch warm bath holiday inn after dark
signs and wonders water stain writing the wall
daniels message blood of the moon on us all
do i care if i despise this nothing else matters i know
in a veil of great disguises how do i live with your ghost
the evil it spread like a fever ahead
it was night when you died my firefly
what could i have said to raise you from the dead
oh could i be the sky on the fourth of july
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
were all gonna die
sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
was it all a disguise like junior high
where everything was fiction future and prediction
now where am i my fading supply
light struck from the lemon tree
what if id never seen hysterical light from eugene
lemon yoghurt remember i pulled at your shirt
i dropped the ashtray on the floor
i just wanted to be near you
emerald park wonders never cease
the man who taught me to swim he couldnt quite say my first name
like a father he led community water on my head
and he called me subaru
and now i want to be near you
im drawn to the blood
the flight of a onewinged dove
how how did this happen
how how did this happen
shall we beat this or celebrate it
youre not the one to talk things through
you checked your texts while i masturbated
manelich i feel so used
i should have known better
to see what i could see
my black shroud
holding down my feelings
a pillar for my enemies
i should have wrote a letter
and grieve what i happen to grieve
my black shroud
i never trust my feelings
i waited for the remedy
when i was three three maybe four
she left us at that video store
be my rest be my fantasy
im light as a feather
im bright as the oregon breeze
my black shroud
frightened by my feelings
i only wanna be a relief
no im not a gogetter
the demon had a spell on me
my black shroud
captain of my feelings
the only thing i wanna believe
spirit of my silence i can hear you but im afraid to be near you
and i dont know where to begin
and i dont know where to begin
somewhere in the desert theres a forest and an acre before us
but i dont know where to begin
but i dont know where to begin
again i lost my strength completely oh be near me tired old mare

tomorrow youll see it through
the clouded out disguises put you in the room
and though i wandered out alone
a thousand lights abounded on our home
and i remember every sound it made
the clouded out disguises and the grave
so yeah i know im still afraid
of letting go of choices i have made
all delighted people raise their hands
and i took you by the sleeve
no other reason than to be leading your leading man
and you woke up with a fright
our lives depended on the visions through the night
all we had always all we had always wanted to before
the hurricane inclined us grappling on the floor
all delighted people raise their hands
still the force of nature spurned
ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement
all delight people raise their hands
im not easily confused
the trouble with the storm inside us grew
but i had so much to give
in spite of all the terror and abuse
and the people bowed and prayed
and what difference does it make for you and me
all delighted people raise their hands
and the people bowed and prayed
and what difference does it make
it doesnt matter anyway
the world surrounds us with its hate
hello darkness my old friend it breaks my heart
ive come to strangle you in spite of what youd like
and dont be a rascal dont be a laughing dog in spite of odds
all im deciphering from the spirits in the light within
all delighted people raise their hands
in restless dreams i walked alone i walked alive
the clouded out disguises left me in a dream of lightness
all delighted people raise their hands
and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and what difference does it make
i love you so much anyway
and on your breast i gently laid
your arms surround me in the lake
i am joined with you forever
and the people bowed and prayed
and what difference does it make for you and me
all delighted people raise their hands
im not easily confused
i feel alive i feel it glowing in the room
all delighted people raise their hands all delighted people
all delighted people raise their hands all delighted people
all delighted people raise their hands all delighted people
all delighted people raise their hands all delighted people
and the people bowed and prayed
oh i love you a lot oh i love you from the top of my heart
and what difference does it make
i still love you a lot oh i love you from the top of my heart
and on your breast i gently laid oh my head in your arms
do you love me from the top of your heart
i tried my best i tried in vain do you love me a lot
dotheres nobody better than you
it took me a while till i knew
but you knew from the start it was us didnt you
it just took me a while till i knew
now i lay as i study a blank wall
would you spare me your voice if i call
cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
you just grew a little smarter too
so i dont blame you if you want to
bury me in your memory im not the girl i ought to be but
maybe when you tell your friends you
can tell them what you saw in me and not how i turned out to be
theres some kind of burning inside me
its kept me from falling apart
and im sure that youve seen what its done to my heart
but its kept me from falling apart
verse 
if i could id be your little spoon
and kiss your fingers forevermore
but big spoon you have so much to do
and i have nothing ahead of me
youre the sun youve never seen the night
but you hear its song from the morning birds
well im not the moon im not even a star
but awake at night ill be singing to the birds
my god im so lonely
so i open the window
to hear sounds of people
to hear sounds of people
venus planet of love

did its people want too much
prechorus
and i dont want your pity

and when you go take this heart
ill make no more use of it when theres no more you
verse 
i was in the bathroom i didnt hear him leave
i locked the door behind him and i turned around to see
all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
well i sighed and mumbled to myself again i have to clean
i sighed and mumbled to myself
verse

and ive turned down
every hand that has beckoned me to come
youre my number one
youre the one i want
and ive turned down
every hand that has beckoned me to come

toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
baby bang it up inside

i thought maybe we would kiss tonight
baby will you kiss me already and
toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
baby bang it up inside
verse 
i steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
and then ill be nothing forever
and all of my memories
and all of the things i have seen will be gone
with my eyes with my body with me
chorus
but me and my husband
we are doing better
its always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime

for such a silly thing
someone who loves me now
better than you
and that pretty friend is
finally yours and

i call you to see you again
so i can win and this can finally end
spend an hour on my makeup
to prove something
verse

its funny how you always remember
and weve both done it all a hundred times before
its funny how i still forgot
verse 
i glow pink in the night in my room
ive been blossoming alone over you
and i hear my heart breaking tonight
i hear my heart breaking tonight
do you hear it too
its like a summer shower
with every drop of rain singing
verse 
i know that i ended it but
why wont you chase after me
you know me better than i do
verse 
all of this turbulence wasnt forecasted
apologies from the intercom
and i am relieved that id left my room tidy
theyll think of me kindly
when they come for my things
theyll never know how id stared at the dark in that room
with no thoughts
like a bloodsniffing shark
and while my dreams made music in the night
carefully
i was going to live
verse 
i gave too much of my heart tonight
can you come to where im staying and make some extra love
that i can save til tomorrows show
verse 
i dont smoke
except for when im missing you
to remember your mouth how it
tasted true
and i dont smoke
except for after ive held you baby
being with you
makes the flame burn good
chorus
so if you need to be mean
be mean to me
i can take it and put it inside of me
if your hands need to break
more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm
as you break my heart

you wouldnt leave till we loved in the morning
youd learned from movies how love ought to be
and youd say you love me and look in my eyes
but i know through mine you were
looking in yours
and did you know the liberty bell is a replica
silently housed in its original walls
and while its dreams played music in the night
quietly
it was told to believe
verse 
i always wanted to die clean and pretty
but id be too busy on working days
so i am relieved that the turbulence wasnt forecasted
i couldnt have changed anyways
i am relieved that id left my room tidy
goodbye

your mother wouldnt approve of how my mother raised me

now here i lay as i wonder about you
would you just tell me what im meant to do
cause ive waited and watered my heart till it grew
you can see how its blossomed for you
and i dont blame you if you want to
bury me in your memory im not the girl i ought to be but
maybe when you tell your friends you
can tell them what you saw in me and not the way i am
and i dont mean to make your heart blue
but could we be what were meant to be
im just about to beg you please and
then when you tell your friends you can
tell them what you saw in me and
not the way i used to be
cause theres nobody better than you
and the people bowed and prayed
oh i love you a lot oh i love you from the top of my heart
and you can see through my mistakes
oh ill tell it to you now oh ill tell it from the top of my heart
when your heirlooms wilted brown
when the devils pushing down
when your mourning has a sound
and you hesitate to laugh
how quickly will your joy pass
how quickly will your joy pass
and when you walk inside i feel the door
ill never let it push your arms no more
and when your legs give out just lie right down
and i will kiss you till your breath is found
and when you walk inside i feel the door
ill never let it push your arms no more
so do you think i came to fight
and do i always think im right
oh no i never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
oh no i only meant to be a friend to everyone this time
and what difference does it make
if the world is a mess if the world is a mess
and on your breast i gently laid
oh ill tell it to you now oh ill tell it to you now
when the worlds come and gone shall we follow our transgressions
or shall we stand strong
i tried to save the things i made
oh but the world is a mess oh but the world is a mess
and what difference does it make if the world is a mess
if the world is a mess
i tried my best i tried in vain
oh but the world is a mess oh but the world is a mess
suffer not the child among you or shall you die young
when the worlds come and gone
suffer not the child among you or shall you die young
when the worlds come and gone

and when you play guitar i listen to the strings buzz
the metal vibrates underneath your fingers
and when you crochet i feel mesmerized and proud
and i would say i love you but saying it out loud is hard
so i wont say it at all
and i wont stay very long
but you are the life i needed all along 
i think of you as my brother
although that sounds dumb
words are futile devicesits been a long long time since ive memorized your face
its been four hours now since ive wandered through your place
and when i sleep on your couch i feel very safe
and when you bring the blankets i cover up my face
i do love you
i do love you
and when you play guitar i listen to the strings buzz
the metal vibrates underneath your fingers
and when you crochet i feel mesmerized and proud
and i would say i love you but saying it out loud is hard
so i wont say it at all
and i wont stay very long
but you are the life i needed all along 
i think of you as my brother
although that sounds dumb
words are futile devices
amethyst and flowers on the table is it real or a fable
well i suppose a friend is a friend
and we all know how this will end
chimney swift that finds me be my keeper
silhouette of the cedar
what is that song you sing for the dead
what is that song you sing for the dead
i see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
well i got nothing to prove
well i got nothing to prove
i forgive you mother i can hear you
and i long to be near you
but every road leads to an end
yes every road leads to an end
your apparition passes through me in the willows and five red hens
youll never see us again
youll never see us again
when i was three and free to explore
i saw her face on the back of the door
be my rest be my fantasy
i should have known better
nothing can be changed
the past is still the past
the bridge to nowhere
i should have wrote a letter
explaining what i feel that empty feeling
dont back down concentrate on seeing
the breakers in the bar the neighbors greeting
my brother had a daughter
the beauty that she brings illumination
dont back down there is nothing left
the breakers in the bar no reason to live
im a fool in the fetter
rose of aarons beard where you can reach me
dont back down nothing can be changed
cantilever bridge the drunken sailor
my brother had a daughter
the beauty that she brings illumination
found myself on spencers butte
traced your shadow with my shoe
empty outline changed my view
now all of me thinks less of you
on the sheet i see your horizon
all of me pressed onto you
but in this light you look like poseidon
im just a ghost you walk right through
saw myself on spencers butte all of me wants all of you
landscape changed my point of view all of me wants all of you
revelation may come true all of me wants all of you
now all of me thinks less of you all of me wants all of you
all of me wants all of you
the strength of his arm
my lover caught me off guard
how head of a rabbit
how head of a rabbit
for my prayer has always been love
what did i do to deserve this
with blood on my sleeve
delilah avenge my grief
how god of elijah
how god of elijah
as fire to the sun
tell me what i have done
how heart of a dragon
how heart of a dragon
for my prayer has always been love
what did i do to deserve this now
how did this happen
since i was old enough to speak ive said it with alarm
some part of me was lost in your sleeve
where you hid your cigarettes
no ill never forget
i just want to be near you
still i pray to what i cannot see
in the sprinkler i mark the evidence known from the start
from the bed near your death and all the machines that made a mess
far away the falcon flew
now i want to be near you
whats left is only bittersweet
for the rest of my life admitting the best is behind me
now im drunk and afraid wishing the world would go away
whats the point of singing songs
if theyll never even hear you
did you get enough love my little dove
why do you cry
and im sorry i left but it was for the best
though it never felt right
my little versailles
the hospital asked should the body be cast
before i say goodbye my star in the sky
such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
do you find it all right my dragonfly
shall we look at the moon my little loon
why do you cry
make the most of your life while it is rife
while it is light
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
were all gonna die
should i tear my eyes out now
everything i see returns to you somehow
should i tear my heart out now
everything i feel returns to you somehow
i want to save you from your sorrow
the only reason why i continue at all
faith in reason i wasted my life playing dumb
signs and wonders sea lion caves in the dark
blind faith gods grace nothing else left to impart
do i care if i survive this bury the dead where theyre found
in a veil of great surprises hold to my head till i drown
should i tear my eyes out now before i see too much
should i tear my arms out now i wanna feel your touch
should i tear my eyes out now
everything i see returns to you somehow
should i tear my heart out now
everything i feel returns to you somehow
carried by stones
fairyland all around us
like a dead horse
sign of your childrens fever
carrie come home
thorazines friend
holding your hands with opai
like a dead horse
shall we ascend
flight of the mayfly
ephemera on my back
she breaks my arm
y breath
my tongue on your chest
what can be said of my heart
if history speaks the kiss on my cheek
where there remains but a mark
beloved my john so ill carry on
counting my cards down to one
and when i am dead come visit my bed
my fossil is bright in the sun
so can we contend peacefully
before my history ends
jesus i need you be near me come shield me
from fossils that fall on my head
theres only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking im dead
now that i fell into your arms
my only lover
give out to give in
i search for the capsule i lost
drag me to hell
in the valley of the dalles
like my mother
give wings to a stone
its only the shadow of a cross
i slept on my back
in the shade of the meadowlark
like a champion
get drunk to get laid
i take one more hit when you depart
ill drive that stake through the center of my heart
lonely vampire
inhaling its fire
im chasing the dragon too far
theres blood on that blade
fuck me im falling apart
my assassin
like casper the ghost
theres no shade in the shadow of the cross
innocence was never lost
though it may have been insulted
even if the earth forgot
her inheritance resulted
in contradiction ceremony
benediction hallelujah
there are no more accidents
living things refuse to offer
explanations of their worth
we in turn avenge the author
with paranoia and prediction
exploration competition
ceremony inner anguish
consequences hallelujah
oh hallelujah
oh hallelujah
oh hallelujah
oh hallelujah
my blue bucket of gold
friend why dont you love me
once the myth has been told
the lens deforms it as lightning
raise your right hand
tell me you want me in your life
or raise your red flag
just when i want you in my life
search for things to extol
friend the fables delight me
my blue bucket of gold
lord touch me with lightning
raise your right hand
tell me you want me in your life
or raise your red flag
just when i want you in my life

it was too hot to make love if you can imagine that except under water and i was never very good at that he wrote to dietrich in a november  note from cuba one of  letters he wrote her from  to  reflecting their deeply intimate flirtatious yet apparently platonic relationship
they adored each other but there was no sexual thing said dietrichs daughter maria riva they were buddies they were friends they were comrades in arms
diego
truth is so great that i wouldnt like to speak or sleep or listen or love to feel myself trapped with no fear of blood outside time and magic within your own fear and your great anguish and within the very beating of your heart all this madness if i asked it of you i know in your silence there would be only confusion i ask you for violence in the nonsense and you you give me grace your light and your warmth id like to paint you but there are no colors because there are so many in my confusion the tangible form of my great love
diego
nothing compares to your hands nothing like the greengold of your eyes my body is filled with you for days and days you are the mirror of the night the violent flash of lightning the dampness of the earth the hollow of your armpits is my shelter my fingers touch your blood all my joy is to feel life spring from your flowerfountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours

nordstrom belongs to the last generation of devoted letter writers she took immense pleasure in the act often writing to authors when there was no obvious necessity of doing so except for the allimportant necessity of keeping a channel open to them although she naturally did much of her editorial work with local authors in person or by phone she also sent long funny perceptive letters to those with whom she had just spoken by telephone or just that day met for lunch time and again she simply could not resist the temptation to write
dear thom
we had your letter this morning i will answer it from my point of view and of course elaine will from hers
first  if you are in love  thats a good thing  thats about the best thing that can happen to anyone dont let anyone make it small or light to you
second  there are several kinds of love one is a selfish mean grasping egotistical thing which uses love for selfimportance this is the ugly and crippling kind the other is an outpouring of everything good in you  of kindness and consideration and respect  not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable the first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength and courage and goodness and even wisdom you didnt know you had
you say this is not puppy love if you feel so deeply  of course it isnt puppy love
but i dont think you were asking me what you feel you know better than anyone what you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it  and that i can tell you
glory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it
the object of love is the best and most beautiful try to live up to it
if you love someone  there is no possible harm in saying so  only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness into consideration
girls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel but they usually like to hear it also
it sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another  but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good
lastly i know your feeling because i have it and im glad you have it
we will be glad to meet susan she will be very welcome but elaine will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to she knows about love too and maybe she can give you more help than i can
and dont worry about losing if it is right it happens  the main thing is not to hurry nothing good gets away
love
she was sitting on the floor in her red velvet jacket  red striped silk shirt i knotting her pearls into heaps of great clustered eggs she had come up to see me  so we go on  a spirited creditable affair i think innocent spiritually  all gain i think rather a bore for leonard but not enough to worry him the truth is one has room for a good many relationships
his is the theory that anything that is art is presumably about some certain thing but is really always about something else and its no good having one without the other because if you just have the something it is boring and if you just have the something else its irritating
dear maurice
dearest  my body is simply crazy with wanting you  if you dont come tomorrow  i dont see how i can wait for you  i wonder if your body wants mine the way mine wants yours  the kisses  the hotness  the wetness  all melting together  the being held so tight that it hurts  the strangle and the struggle
ive wanted to write you a note and tell you over the phone that your new ideas for the ending of kennys window seem wonderful to me and im sure its going to be a beautiful book keep working on it and when you have all the chapters together you and i can go over it word for word and get down to brass tacks you should forgive the originality of my prose style but the main thing is thanks for everything i am sure you are doing to the book the pages you showed me the other day in the vanderbilt made me very very very happy
as for your color pictures for the krauss book  words are no good whatsoever there are a few peaks in an editors life and seeing those pictures of yours has been a peak of mine they are indescribably lovely and absolutely perfect and  well pure in the best sense

it was the thirst of many years restrained in our body chained words which we could not say except on the lips of dreams everything was surrounded by the green miracle of the landscape of your body upon your form the lashes of the flowers responded to my touch the murmur of streams there was all manner of fruits in the juice of your lips the blood of the pomegranate the horizon of the mammee and the purified pineapple i pressed you against my breast and the prodigy of your form penetrated all my blood through the tips of my fingers smell of oak essence memories of walnut green breath of ash tree horizon and landscapes  i traced them with a kiss oblivion of words will form the exact language for understanding the glances of our closed eyes  you are here intangible and you are all the universe which i shape into the space of my room your absence springs trembling in the ticking of the clock in the pulse of light you breathe through the mirror from you to my hands i caress your entire body and i am with you for a minute and i am with myself for a moment and my blood is the miracle which runs in the vessels of the air from my heart to yours
the green miracle of the landscape of my body becomes in your the whole of nature i fly through it to caress the rounded hills with my fingertips my hands sink into the shadowy valleys in an urge to possess and im enveloped in the embrace of gentle branches green and cool i penetrate the sex of the whole earth her heat chars me and my entire body is rubbed by the freshness of the tender leaves their dew is the sweat of an evernew lover
its not love or tenderness or affection its life itself my life that i found what i saw it in your hands in your month and in your breasts i have the taste of almonds from your lips in my mouth our worlds have never gone outside only one mountain can know the core of another mountain
your presence floats for a moment or two as if wrapping my whole being in an anxious wait for the morning i notice that im with you at that instant still full of sensations my hands are sunk in oranges and my body feels surrounded by your arms

a precious mouldering pleasure t is
to meet an antique book
in just the dress his century wore
a privilege i think
his venerable hand to take
and warming in our own
a passage back or two to make
to times when he was young
his quaint opinions to inspect
his knowledge to unfold
on what concerns our mutual mind
the literature of old
what interested scholars most
what competitions ran
when plato was a certainty
and sophocles a man
when sappho was a living girl
and beatrice wore
the gown that dante deified
facts centuries before
he traverses familiar
as one should come to town
and tell you all your dreams were true
he lived where dreams were sown
his presence is enchantment
you beg him not to go
old volumes shake their vellum heads
and tantalize just so
success
published in a masque of poets at the request of hh the authors fellowtownswoman and friend
success is counted sweetest
by those who neer succeed
to comprehend a nectar
requires sorest need
not one of all the purple host
who took the flag today
can tell the definition
so clear of victory
as he defeated dying
on whose forbidden ear
the distant strains of triumph
break agonized and clear
all trials are trials for ones life just as all sentences are sentences of death and three times i have been tried the first time i left the box to be arrested the second time to be led back to the house of detention and the third time to pass into prison for two years society as we have constituted it will have no place for me has none to offer but nature whose sweet rains fall on just and unjust alike will have clefts in the rocks where i may hide and secret valleys in whose silence i may weep undisturbed she will hang with stars so that i may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt she will cleanse me in great waters and with bitter herbs make me whole

was santiago doomed ilis cliancc had come 
 swooped upon it plundered it and was gone 
leaving the treacherous isle a desolate heap 
of smoking ashes in the leaden sea 
while onward all those pirate bowsprits plunged 
into the golden west across the broad 
atlantic once again ior i will show 
said drake that englishmen henceforth will sail 
old ocean where thej will onward they surged 
and the great glittering crested majestic waves 
julilantly rushed up to meet the keels 
and there was nought around them but the gicy 
ruin and roar of the huge atlantic seas 
grey mounded seas pursuing and pursued 
that fl hounded and hounding on for ever 
from empty marge to marge of the grey sky 
over the wandering wilderness of foam 
onward through storm and death  swept for no 
once more a fell plague gripped the tossing ships 
and not by twos and threes as heretofore 
his crews were minished but in three black days 
three hundred seamen in their shotted shrouds 
were cast into the deep onward he swept 
implacably having in mind to strike 
spain in the throat at st domingo port 
of hispaniola a city of far renown 
a jewel on the shores of old romance 
palmshadowed gated with immortal gold 
queen city of spains dominions over sea 
and guarded by great guns out of the davn 
the pirate ships came leaping grim and black 
and ere the spaniards were awake the flag 
of england floated from their topmost tower 
but since he had not troops enough to hold 
so great a city  entrenched his men 
within the plaza and held the batteries 
thence he demanded ransom and sent out 
a boy with flag of truce the boys return 
 waited long under a sheltering palm 
he stood watching the enemies camp and lo 
along the hot white purpleshadowed road 
tovrds him a crawling shape writhed through the dust 
up to his feet a shape besmeared with blood 
a shape that held the stumps up of its wrists 
and moaned an eyeless thing a naked rag 
of flesh obscenely mangled a small face 
hideously puckered shrivelled like a monkeys 
with lips drawn backward from its teeth 
speak speak 
in gods name speak what art thou whispered drake 
and a sharp cry came answering his dread 
a cry as of a seabird in the wind 
desolately astray from all earths shores 
captain i am thy boy only thy boy 
see see my captain see what they have done 
captain i only bore the flag i only  
 lad lad lad moaned drake and stooping strove 
to pillow the mangled head upon his arm 
 what have they done to thee what have they done 
and at the touch the boy screamed once and died 
then like a savage sea with arms uplift 
to heaven the wrath of  blazed thundermg 
eternal god be this the doom of spain 
henceforward have no pity send the strength 
of thy great seas into my soul that i 
may devastate this empire this red hell 
they make of thy good earth 
his men drew round 
staring in horror at the silent shape 
that daubed his feet like a cold wind 
his words went through their flesh 
this is the m 
that bore our flag of truce this hath spain done 
look well upon it draw the smoke of the blood 
up into your nostrils my companions 
and down into your souls this makes an end 
for spain  bring forth the spanish prisoners 
and let me look on them 
forth they were brought 
a swarthy gorgeous band of soldiers priests 
and sailors hedged between tvo sturdy files 
of british tars vsith naked cutlasses 
close up to  they halted under the palm 
gay smiling prisoners for they thought their friends 
had ransomed them then they looked up and met 
a glance that swept athwart them like a sword 
making the blood strain back from their blanched faces 
into their quivering hearts with unknown dread 
as that accuser pointed to the shape 
before his feet 
 dogs will ye lap his blood 
before ye die make haste for it grous cold 
ye will not will not even dabble your hands 
in that red puddle of flesh what are ye spaniards 
come come ill look at you perchance theres one 
thats but a demidevil and holds you back 
and with the word  stepped among their ranks 
and read each face among the swarthy crew  
the gorgeous soldiers ringleted sailors priests 
with rosary and cross a slender page 
in scarlet vrith a cloud of golden hair 
and two ropegirdled friars 
the slim page 
 drew before the throng you are young he said 
go take this message to the camp of spain 
tell them i have a hunger in my soul 
to look upon the murderers of this boy 
to see what eyes they have what manner of mouths 
to touch them and to take their hands in mine 
and draw them close to me and smue upon them 
until they know my soul as i know theirs 
and they grovel in the dust and grope for mercy 
say that until i get them every day 
ill hang two spaniards though i dispeople 
the spanish main tell them that every day 
ill bum a portion of their city down 
then find another city and burn that 
and then bum others till i burn away 
their empire from the world ay till i reach 
the imperial throne of philip with my fires 
and send it shrieking down to burn in hell 
for ever go 
then  turned once again 
to face the spanish prisoners with a voice 
cold as the passionless utterance of fate 
his grim command went forth now provostmarshal 
begin with yon two friars in whose faces 
chined like singed swine and eyed with the spent coals 
of filthy living sweats the glory of spain 
strip off their leprous rags 
and twist their ropes around their throats and hang them 
high over the spanish camp for all to see 
at dawn ill choose two more 
book x 
across the atlantic 
great rumours rushed as of a mighty wind 
the wind of the spirit of drake but who shall tell 
in this cold age the power that he became 
who drew the universe within his soul 
and moved with cosmic forces though the deep 
divided it from drake the gorgeous court 
of philip shuddered away from the streaming coasts 
as a windcuffed field of golden wheat the king 
bidding his guests to a feast in his own ship 
on that winddarkened sea was made a mock 
as one by one his ladies proffered excuse 
for fear of that beyond round europe now 
ballad and story told how in the cabin 
of francis  there hung a magic glass 
wherein he saw the fleets of every foe 
and all that passed aboard them rome herself 
perplexed that this proud heretic should prevail 
fostered a darker dream that  had bought 
like old norse wizards power to loose or bind 
the winds at will 
and now a wilder tale 
flaslicd oer the deep  of a distant bloodred dawn 
oer san domingo where the embattled troops 
of spain and  were met  but not in war 
met in the dawn by his compelling will 
to offer up a sacrifice yea there 
between the hosts the hands of sain herself 
slaughtered the spanish murderers of the boy 
who had borne drakes flag of truce offered them up 
as a bloodoftering and an expiation 
lest drake with that dread alchemy of his soul 
should een transmute the dust beneath their feet 
to one same substance with the lace of pain 
and whelm them suddenl in the eternal fires 
rumour on rumour rushed across the sea 
large mockeries and one most bitter of all 
wormwood to philip of how  had stood 
r the governors house at san domingo and seen 
a mighty scutcheon of the king of spain 
whereon was pamted the terrestrial globe 
and on the globe a mighty steed in act 
to spring into the heavens and from its mouth 
streaming like smoke a scroll and on the scroll 
three words of flame and fury  xoi sufficit 
orbis  of how  and his seamen stood 
gazing upon it and could not forbear 
from summoning the spaniards to expound 
its meaning whereupon a hurricane roar 
of mirth burst from those bearded british lips 
and that inmiortal laughter shook the world 
so while the imperial warrior eyes of sjain 
watched every hour her vast armada grow 
readier to launch and shatter with one stroke 
our islands frail defence fear gripped her still 
for there came sounds across the heaving sea 
of secret springs unsealed forces unchained 
a mustering of deep elemental powers 
a sound as of the burgeoning of boughs 
in universal april and dead hearts 
uprising from their tombs a mighty cry 
of resurrection surging through the souls 
of all mxanldnd for now the last wild tale 
swept like another dawn across the deep 
and in that dawn men saw the slaves of spain 
the mutilated negroes of the mines 
with gaunt backs wealed and branded scarred and seared 
by whip and iron in spains brute lust for gold 
saw them at drakes great liberating word 
burst from their chains erect uplifting hands 
of rapture to the glad new light that then 
then first began to struggle thro the clouds 
and crown all manhood with a sacred crown 
august  a light which though from age to age 
clouds may obscure it grows and still shall grow 
until that kingdom come that grand communion 
that commonweal that empire which still draws 
nigher with every hour that federation 
that turning of the wasteful strength of war 
to accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace 
that gathering up of one anothers loads 
whereby the weak are strengthened and the strong 
made stronger in the increasing good of all 
then suddenly it seemed as he had gone 
a ship came stealing into plymouth sound 
and  was home again but not to rest 
for scarce had he cast anchor ere the road 
to london rang beneath the flying hoofs 
that bore his brief despatch to burleigh saying  
we have missed the plate fleet by but twelve hours sail 
the reason being best known to god no less 
we have given a cooling to the king of spain 
there is a great gap opened which methinks 
is little to his liking we have sacked 
the towns of his chief indies burnt their ships 
captured great store of gold and precious stones 
three hundred pieces of artillery 
the more part brass our loss is heavy indeed 
under the hand of god eight hundred men 
three parts of them by sickness captain moone 
my trusty old companion he that struck 
the first blow in the south seas cat a spaniard 
died of a grievous wound at cartagena 
ly fleet and i are ready to strike again 
at once whereer the queen and england please 
i pray for her commands and those ith speed 
that i may strike again outside the scroll 
these words were writ once more  my queens commands 
i much desire your servant francis drake 
this terse despatch the hunchback burleigh read 
thrice over with the broad cliff of his brow 
bending among his looks thrice he assayed 
to steel himself with caution as of old 
and thrice as a glorious lightning running along 
and flashing between those simple words he saw 
the great new power that lay at englands hand 
an oceansovereignty a power unknown 
before but dawning now a power that swept 
all earths old plots and counterplots away 
like straws the germ of an unmeasured force 
newborn that laid the source of spanish might 
at englands mercy could that force but grow 
ere spain should nip it ere the mighty host 
that waited in the xetherlands even now 
that host of thirty thousand men encamped 
round antwerp under parma should embark 
convoyed by that invincible armada 
to leap at englands throat thrice he assayed 
to think of englands helplessness her ships 
little and few thrice he assajed to quench 
with caution the high furnace of his soul 
which  had kindled as he read tlie last 
rough simple plea i wait my queens commands 
his deep eyes flashed with glorious tears 
lie leapt 
to his feet and cried aloud before my god 
i am proud i am very proud for englands sake 
this  is a teriiblc man to the king of spain

englishmen  
tore god 
cried walsingham my queen u do them tong 
there is another rome  not this of spain 
which lurks to pluck the world back into darkness 
and stab it there for gold there is a city 
ttiose eyes are towrd the morning on whose heights 
blazes the cross of chxrist above the world 
a rome that shall wage warfare yet for god 
in the dark days to come a rome whose thought 
shall march with our humanity and be proud 
to cast old creeds like seed into the ground 
watch the strange shoots and foster the new flower 
of faiths we know not jet is this a dieam 
i speak as one by knighthood bound to speak 
for even this day  and my heart burns with it  
i heard the catholic gentlemen of england 
speaking in grave assembly at one breath 
of peril to our island why their swords 
leapt from their scabbards and their crj went up 
to split the heavens  god save our english queen  
even as he spake there passed the rushing gleam 
of torches once again and as they stood 
silently listening all the winds ran wild 
with clamouring bells and a great cry went up  
god save elizabeth our english queen 
ill vouch for some two hundred catholic throats 
among that thousand whispered walsingham 
eagerly with his eyes on the queens face 
then seeing it brighten ferently he cried 
pressing the swift advantage home o madam 
the heart of england now is all on fire 
we are one people as we have not been 
in all our history all prepared to die 
around your throne madam you are beloved 
as never yet was english king or queen 
she looked at him the tears in her keen eyes 
glittered  and i am very proud she said 
but if our enemies command the world 
and we have one small island and no more  
she ceased and drake in a strange voice hoarse and low 
trcmbliiig with passion deeper than all speech 
crietl out  no more than the great oceansea 
which makes the enemies coast our frontier now 
no more than that great empire of the deep 
whicli rolls from pole to pole washing the world 
with thunder that great empire whose command 
this da is yours to take hear me my queen 
this is a dream a new dream but a true 
for mightier days are dawning on the world 
than heart of man hath known if england hold 
the sea she holds the hundred thousand gates 
that open to futurity she holds 
the higliway of all ages argosies 
of unknown glory set their sails this day 
for england out of ports beyond the stars 
ay on the sacred seas we neer shall know 
they hoist their sails this day by peaceful quays 
great gleaming whanes in the perfect cityof god 
if she but clahn her heritage 
he ceased 
and the deep dream of that new realm the sea 
through all the soul of gloriana surged 
a moment then with splendid eyes that filled 
with fire of sunsets far awaj she cried 
faith making her a child yet quecnlier still 
yea claim it tliou for me 
a moment there 
trembling she stood then once again there passed 
a rush of torches through the gloom without 
and a great cry god save elizabeth 
god save our english queen 
yea go then go  
she said god speed you now sir francis drake 
not as a privateer but with full powers 
my admiralattheseas 
without a word 
 bent above her hand and ere she knew it 
his eyes from the dark doorwaj flashed farewell 
and he was gone but ere he leapt to saddle 
walsingham stood at his stirrup muttering ride 
ride now like hell to plymouth for the queen 
is hard beset and ere ye are out at sea 
her mood will change the friends of spain will move 
earth and the heavens for your recall theyll tempt her 
with their false baits of peace though i shall starid 
here at your back through thick and thin farewell 
fire flashed beneath the hoofs and  was gone 
scarce had he vanished in the night than doubt 
once more assailed the queen the death of mary 
had brought een france against her walsingham 
and burleigh himself prime mover of that death 
being held in much disfavour for it stood 
as helpless long ere  or human power 
they thought could put to sea a courier sped 
to plymouth bidding  forbear to strike 
at spain but keep to the high seas and lo 
the roadstead glittered empty  was gone 
gone though the friends of spain had poured their gold 
to thin his ranks and every hour his crews 
deserted he had laughed  let spain buy scum 
next to an honest seaman i love best 
an honest landsman what more goodly task 
than teaching brave men seamanship he had filled 
his ships with soldiers out in the teeth of the gale 
that raged against him he had driven in vain 
amid the boisterous laughter of the quays 
a pinnace dashed in hot pursuit and met 
a roaring breaker and came hurthng back 
with oars and spars all trailing in the foam 
a tangled mass of wreckage and despair 
sky swept to stormy sky no sail could live 
in that great yeast of waves but  was gone 
then once again across the rolling sea 
great rumours rushed of how he had sacked the port 
of cadiz and had swept along the coast 
to lisbon where the whole armada lay 
had snapped up prizes under its very nose 
and taunted santa cruz high admiral 
of spain striving to draw him out for fight 
and offering if his course should lie that way 
to convoy liim to britain taunted him 
so bitterly that for once in the worhls eyes 
a jest had power to kill for santa cruz 
died with the spleen of it since he could not move 
before the appointed season then there came 
flying back home the queens old admiral 
borough deserting  and all aghast 
at drakes temerity for he said this man 
thrust oer my head against all precedenl 
bade me follow him into harbour mouths 
aflame with cannon like the jaws of death 
whereat i much demurred and straightway  
clapped me in irons me  an officer 
and admiral of the queen and though my voice 
was all against it plunged into the pit 
without me left me with some word that burns 
and ranldes in me still making me fear 
the man was mad some word of lonely seas 
a desert island and a mutineer 
and dead jniagellans gallows sirs my life 
was hardly safe with him why he resolved 
to storm the castle of st vincent sirs 
a castle on a cliff grinning with guns 
well known impregnable the spaniards fear 
drake but to see him land below it and bid 
surrender sirs the strongest fort of spain 
without a blow they laughed and straightvray he 
with all the fury of satan turned that cliff 
to hell itself he sent down to the ships 
for faggots broken oars beams bowsprits masts 
and piled them up against the outer gates 
higher and higher and fired them there he stood 
amid the smoke and flame and cannonshot 
this admiral like a common seamen black 
with soot besmeared with blood his naked arms 
full of great faggots labouring like a giant 
and roaring like apollyon sirs he is mad 
but did he take it say you yea he took it 
the mightiest stronghold on the coast of spain 
took it and tumbled all its big brass guns 
clattering over the cliffs into the sea 
but sirs ye need not raise a cheer so loud 
it is not warfare twas a madmans trick 
a devils 
then the rumour of a storm 
that scattered the fleet of  to the four winds 
disturbed the heart of england as his ships 
came straggling into harbour one by one 
saying they could not find him then at last 
when the storm burst in its earthshaking might 
along our coasts one night of rolling gloom 
his cannon woke old plymouth in he came 
across the thunder and lightning of the sea 
with his grim ship of war and close behind 
a shadow like a mountain or a cloud 
torn from the heavenhigh panoplies of spain 
a captured galleon loomed and round her prow 
a blazoned scroll whence as she neared the quays 
which many a lanthorn swung from brawny fist 
yellowed the sudden crimson of her name 
san filippe flashed oer the white sea of faces 
and a rending shout went skyward that outroared 
the blanching breakers   tis the heart of spain 
the great san filippe overhead she towered 
the mightiest ship afloat and in her hold 
the riches of a continent a prize 
greater than earth had ever known for there 
not only ruby and pearl like oceanbeaches 
heaped on some wizard coast in that dim hull 
blazed to the lanthornlight not only gold 
gleamed though of gold a million would not buy 
her store but in her cabin lay the charts 
and secrets of the wild unwhispered wealth 
of india secrets that splashed london wharves 
with coloured dreams and made her misty streets 
flame like an eastern city when the sun 
shatters itself on jevelled domes and spills 
its crimson wreclcage thro the silvery palms 
and of those dreams the far east india quest 
began  the first foundationstone was laid 
of our great indian empire and a star 
began to tremble on the brows of england 
that time can never darken 
but now the seas 
darkened indeed with menace now at hist 
the cohl wind of the black approaching wings 
of azrael crept across tiie deep the storm 
throbbed witii their thunderous pulse and ere that moon 
waned a swift gunboat foamed into the sound 
with word that all the invincible armada 
was hoisting sail for england 
even now 
elizabeth torn a thousand wajs withheld 
the word for which  pleatled as for life 
that he might meet them ere they left their coasts 
meet them or ever they reached the channel meet them 
now or  too late too late at last his voice 
beat domi een those that blindly dinned her ears 
vvith chatter of meeting sain on british soil 
and swiftly she commanded seeing once more 
the light that burned amid the approaching gloom 
in drakes deep eyes lord howard of efiingham 
high admiral of england straight to join him 
at plymouth sound plow many ships are wanted 
she asked him thinking we are few indeed 
give me but sixteen merchantmen he said 
and but four battleships by the mercy of god 
ril answer for the armada out to sea 
they swept in the teeth of a gale but vainly  
strove to impart the thought wherewith his mind 
travailed  to win command of the oceansea 
by bursting on the fleets of spain at once 
even as they left their ports not as of old 
to hover in a vain dream of defence 
round fifty threatened points of british coast 
but howard clinging to his oldworld order 
flung out his ships in a loose long straggling line 
across the channel waiting wary alert 
but powerless thus as a string of scattered seagulls 
beating against the storm then flying to meet them 
a merchantman brought terror down the wind 
with news that she had seen that monstrous host 
stretching from sky to sky great hulks of doom 
dragging deaths midnight with them oer the sea 
towrds england up to howards flagship  
in his immortal battleship  revenge 
rushed thro the foam and thro the swirling seas 
his pinnace dashed alongside on to the decks 
 the tossing flagship like a very viking 
shaking the surf and rainbows of the spray 
from sunsmit lionlike mane and beard he stood 
before lord howard in the escutcheoned poop 
and poured his heart out like the rending sea 
in passionate wave on wave  
 if yonder fleet 
once reach the channel hardly the mercy of god 
saves england i would pray with my last breath 
let us beat up to windward of them now 
and handle them before they reach the channel 
nay but we cannot bare the coast cried howard 
nor have we stores of powder or food enough 
my lord said drake with his great arm outstretched 
there is food enough in yonder enemys ships 
and powder enough and cannonshot enough 
we must re victual there look look he cried 
and pointed to the heavens as for a soul 
that by sheer force of will compels the world 
to work his bidding so it seemed the wind 
that blew against them slowly veered the sails 
quivered the skies revolved a northerly breeze 
awoke and now behind the british ships 
blew steadily towrds the unseen host of spain 
it is the breath of god cried drake they lie 
windbound and we may work our will with them 
signal the word lord howard and drive down 
and as a man convinced by heaven itself 
lord howard ordered straightway the whole fleet 
to advance 
and now indeed as  foresaw 
the armada lay beyond the dim horizon 
windbound and helpless in corunna bay 
at englands mercy could her fleet but draw 
nigh enough with its fireships and great guns 
to windward nearer nearer league by league 
the ships of england came till ushant lay 
some seventy leagues beliind then yet once more 
the wind veered straight against them to remain 
beating against it idly was to starve 
and as a man wliose jiowcr upon the world 
fails for one moment of exhausted will 
drake gathering up his forces as he went 
for one more supreme effort turned his ship 
towrds plymouth and retreated with the rest 
there while the ships refitted with all haste 
and axe and hammer rang one golden eve 
just as the setting sun began to fringe 
the clouds with crimson and the creaming waves 
were one wild riot of fair rainbows  
stood ith old comrades on the closecropped green 
of plymouth hoe playing a game of bowls 
far off unseen a little barque fullsail 
struggled and leapt and strove towrds plymouth sound 
noteless as any speckled herringgull 
flickering between the white flakes of the waves 
a group of schoolbojs wdth their satchels lay 
stretched on the green gazing with great dde eyes 
upon their seamen heroes as like gods 
disporting with the battles of the world 
they loomed tossing black bowls like cannonballs 
against the rosy west or lounged at ease 
with faces olivedark against that sky 
laughing while from the neighboring inn mine host 
white aproned and bluejerkined hurried out 
with foaming cups of sack and they drank deep 
tossing their heads back under the golden clouds 
and burying their bearded lips the hues 
that slashed their doublets for the boys bright eyes 
even as the gleams of grecian cloud or moon 
revealed the old gods were here rich dusky streaks 
of splendour from the spanish main that shone 
but to proclaim these heroes there a boy 
more bold crept nearer to a slouched hat thrown 
upon the green and touched the silver plume 
and felt as if he had touched a sunsetisle 
of feathery palms beyond a crimson sea 
another stared at the blue rings of smoke 
a stormscarred seaman puffed from a long pipe 
primed with the strange new herb they had lately found 
in far virginia but the little ship 
now plunging into plymouth bay none saw 
een when she had anchored and her straining boat 
had touched the land and the boats crew over the quays 
leapt with a shout scarce was there one to heed 
a seaman smiling swaggered out of the inn 
swinging in one brown hand a gleaming cage 
wherein a big green parrot chattered and clung 
fluttering against the wires a troop of girls 
with arms linked paused to watch the game of bowls 
and now they flocked around the cage while one 
with rosy finger tempted the horny beak 
to bite close overhead a seamew flashed 
seaward once from an open window soft 
through trellised leaves not far away a voice 
floated a voice that flushed the cheek of drake 
the voice of bess bending her glossy head 
over the broidery frame in a quiet song 
the song ceased still with rainbows in their eyes 
the schoolboys watched the bowls like cannonballs 
roll from the hand of gods along the turf 
suddenly towrds the green a little cloud 
of seamen shouting stumbling as they ran 
drew all eyes on them the game ceased a voice 
rough with the storms of many an ocean roared 
drake capen drake the armada 
they are in the channel we sighted them  
a line of battleships we could not see 
an end of them they stretch from north to south 
like a great storm of clouds glinting with guns 
from sky to sky 
so after all his strife 
the wasted weeks had tripped him the fierce hours 
of pleading for the seas command great hours 
and golden moments all were lost the fleet 
of spain had won the channel without a blow 
all eyes were turned on dralce as he stood there 
a giant against the sunset and the sea 
looming alone far off the first white star 
gleamed in a rosy space of heaven he tossed 
a grim black ball i the lustrous air and laughed  
come lads he said weve time to finish the game  
book xi 
few minutes and well wasted those were spent 
on that great game of bowls for well knew  
what panic threatened plymouth since his fleet 
lay trapped there by the black headwind that blew 
straight up the sound and plymouth town itself 
except the ships won seaward ere the dawn 
lay at the armadas mercy never a seaman 
of all the seadogs clustered on the quays 
and all the captains clamouring round lord howard 
hoped that one ship might win to the open sea 
at dawn they thought the armadas rolling guns 
to windward in an hour must shatter them 
huddled in their red slaughterhouse like sheep 
now was the great sun sunken and the night 
dark far to westward like the soul of man 
fighting blind nature a ld flare of red 
upon some windy headland suddenly leapt 
and vanished flickering into the clouds again 
it leapt and vanished then all at once it streamed 
steadily as a crimson torch upheld 
by titan hands to heaven it was the first 
beacon a sudden silence swept along 
the seething quays and in their midst appeared 
drake 
then the jubilant thunder of his voice 
rolled buftcting the scaaind far and nigh 
and ere they knew what power as of a sea

surged through them his immortal battleship 
revenge had flung out cables to the quays 
and while the seamen as he had commanded 
knotted thick ropes together he stood apart 
for well he knew what panic threatened still 
whittling idly at a scrap of wood 
and carved a little boat out for the child 
of some old seacompanion 
so great and calm a master of the world 
seemed  that as he whittled and the chips 
fluttered into the blackness over the quay 
men said that in this hour of englands need 
each tiny flake turned to a battleship 
for now began the lanthorns one by one 
to glitter and half reveal the shadowy hulks 
before him  so the huge old legend grew 
not all unworthy the homeric age 
of gods and godlike men 
st michaels mount 
answering the first wild beacon far away 
rolled crimson thunders to the stormy sky 
the ropes were knotted through the panting dark 
great heaving lines of seamen all together 
hauled with a shout and all together again 
hauled with a shout against the roaring wind 
and slowly slowly onward towrds the sea 
moved the revenge and seaward ever heaved 
the brawny backs together and in their midst 
suddenly as they slackened  was there 
hauling like any ten and with his heart 
doubling the strength of all giving them joy 
of battle against those odds  ay till they found 
delight in the burning tingle of the blood 
that even their hardy hands must feel besmear 
the harsh rough straining ropes there as they toiled 
answering a score of hills old beachy head 
streamed like a furnace to the rolling clouds 
then all around the coast each windy ness 
and craggy mountain kindled peak from peak 
caught the tremendous fire and passed it on 
round the bluff east and the black mouth of thames  
up northward to the waste wild yorkshire fells 
and gloomy cumberland where like a giant 
great skiddaw grasped uie red lenipestuous brand 
and thrust it up against the reeling heavens 
then all night long inland the wandering winds 
ran wild with elaniour and clash of startled bells 
all night the cities seethed with torches flashed 
with twent thousand flames of burnished steel 
while over the tramjle and thunder of hooves blazed forth 
the lightning of wild trumpets lonely lanes 
of country darkness lit by cottage doors 
entwined vith rose and honeysuclde roared 
like mountaintorrents now  last avest and south 
as to the coasts nth pike and musket streamed 
the trained bands horse and foot from every town 
and every hamlet all the shaggy hills 
from milford haven to the downs of kent 
and up to ilumber gleamed with many a hedge 
of pikes between the beacons crimson glares 
while in red london fortj thousand men 
li case the invader should prevail drew swords 
around their queen all night in dark st paids 
while round it rolled a multitudinous roar 
as of the atlantic on a aestern beach 
and all the leaning london streets were lit 
with fury of torches rose the passionate prayer 
of englands peril 
lord god of hosts 
let thine enemies know that thou hast taken 
england into thine hands 
the mighty sound 
rolled billowing round the kneeling aisles then died 
echoing up the heights a voice far off 
as on the cross of calvary caught it up 
and poured the prayer oer that deep hush alone 
we beseech thee god to go before our armies 
bless and prosper them both by land and sea 
grant unto them thy victory god 
as thou uscdd to do to thy children when they please thee 
all power all strength all victory come from thee 
then from the lips of all those thousands burst 
a sound as from the rent heart of an ocean 
one tumult one great rushing storm of wings 
cleaving the darkness round the gates of heaven 
some pnt their trust in chariots and some in horses 
bid we will remember thy name lord our god 
so while at plymouth sound her seamen toiled 
all through the night and scarce a ship had won 
seaward the heart of england cried to god 
all night while trumpets yelled and blared without 
and signal cannon shook the blazoned panes 
and billowing multitudes went thundering by 
amid that solemn pillared hush arose 
from lips of kneeling thousands one great prayer 
storming the gates of heaven  lord our god 
heavenly father have mercy upon our queen 
to whom thy far dispersed flock do fly 
in the anguish of their souls behold behold 
how many princes band themselves against her 
how long thy servant hath laboured to them for peace 
how proudly they prepare themselves for battle 
arise therefore maintain thine own cause 
judge thou between her and her eiiemies 
she seeketh not her own honour but thine 
not the dominions of others but thy truth 
not bloodshed but the saving of the afflicted 
rend the heavens therefore and come down 
deliver thy people 
to vanquish is all one with thee by few 
or many want or wealth weakness or strength 
the cause is thine the enemies thine the afflicted 
thine the honour victory and trimnph 
thine grant her people now one heart ie mind 
one strength give unto her councils and her captains 
wisdom and courage strongly to withstand 
the forces of her enemies that the fame 
and glory of thy kingdom may be spread 
unto the ends of the world father we crave 
this in thy mercy for the precious death 
of thy dear son our saviour jesus christ 
amen 
and as the dreadful dawn thro mistwreaths broke 
and out of plymouth sound at last with checri 
ringing from many a thousand tliroats tlicrc struggled 
six little ships all that the nights long toil 
had warped down to the sea but leading them 
the ship of drake there rose one oceancry 
from all those worshippers  let god arise 
and let his enemies be scattered 
under the leaden fogs of that new dawn 
empty and cold indifferent as death 
the sea heaved strangely to the seamens ecs 
seeing all round them only the leaden surge 
wrapped in wet mists or flashing here and there 
with crumbling white against the cold wet wind 
westward the little ships of england beat 
with short tacks close inshore striving to win 
the windward station of the threatening battle 
that neared behind the veil six little ships 
no more beat westward even as all manldnd 
beats up against that universal wind 
whereon like withered leaves all else is blown 
down one wide way to death  the soul alone 
whether at last it wins or faints and fails 
stems the dark tide with its intrepid sails 
closehauled th many a short tack struggled and strained 
northwest southwest the ships but ever westward gained 
some little way with every tack and soon 
while the prows plunged beneath the gregold noon 
lapped by the crackling waves even as the wind 
died down a little in the mists behind 
stole out from plymouth sound the struggling score 
of ships that might not win last night to sea 
they followed but the six went on before 
not knowing alone for god and liberty 
now as they tacked northwest the sullen roar 
of reefs crept out or some strange tinkling sound 
of sheep upon the hills southwest once more 
the bosuns whistle swung their bowsprits round 
southwest until the long low lapping splash 
was all they heard of keels that still ran out 
seaward then with one muffled heave and crash 
once more the whistles brought their sails about 
and now the noon began to wane the west 
with slow rich colours filled and shadowy forms 
dark curdling wreaths and fogs with crimsoned breast 
and tangled zones of dusk like frozen storms 
motionless flagged with sunset hulled with doom 
motionless nay across the darkening deep 
surely the whole sky moved its gorgeous gloom 
onward and like the curtains of a sleep 
the red fogs crumbled mists dissolved away 
there like deaths secret dawning thro a dream 
great thrones of thunder dusked the dying day 
and higher pale towers of cloud began to gleam 
there in one heavenwide storm great masts and clouds 
of sail crept slowly forth the ships of spain 
from north to south their tangled spars and shrouds 
controlled the slow wind as with bit and rein 
onward they rode in insolent disdain 
sighting the little fleet of england there 
while oer the sullen splendour of the main 
three solemn guns tolled all their host to prayer 
and their great ensign blazoned all the doomfraught air 
the sacred standard of their proud crusade 
up to the masthead of their flagship soared 
on one side knelt the holy mothermaid 
on one the crucified redeemer poured 
his blood and all their kneeling hosts adored 
their saints and clouds of incense heavenward streamed 
while pomp of cannonry and pike and sword 
down long sealanes of mocking menace gleamed 
and chant of priests rolled out oer seas that darldy dreamed 
who comes to fight for england is it ye 
six little straws that dance upon the foam 
ay sweeping oer the sunsetcrimsoned sea 
let the jroud pageant in its glory come 
leaving the sunset like a hecatomb 
of souls whose bodies yet endure the chain 
let slaves by thousands randed scarred and dumb 
in those dark galleys grip their oars again 
and oer the rolling deep bring on the pomp of spain  
bring on tlie pomp of royal paladins 
for all the princedoms of the land are there 
and for the gorgeous purple of their sins 
the papal pomp bring on with psalm and prayer 
nearer the splendour heaves can ye not hear 
the rushing foam not see the blazoned arms 
and blackfaced hosts thro leagues of golden air 
crowding the decks muttering their beads and charms 
to where in furthest heaven they thicken like locustswarms 
bring on the pomp and pride of old castille 
blazon the skies with royal aragon 
beneath oquendo let old ocean reel 
the purple pomp of priestly rome bring on 
and let her censers dusk the dying sun 
the thunder of her banners on the breeze 
folloing sidonias glorious galleon 
deride the sleeping thunder of the seas 
while twenty thousand warriors chant her litanies 
lo all their decks are kneeling sky to sky 
responds it is their solemn evening hour 
salve regina though the daylight die 
salve regina though the darkness lour 
have they not still the kingdom and the power 
salve regina hark their thousands cry 
from where like clouds to where like mountains tower 
their crowded galleons looming far or nigh 
salve regina hark what distant seas reily 
what distant seas what distant ages hear 
bring on the pomp the sun of spain goes down 
the moon but swells the tide of praise and prayer 
bring on the worldwide pomp of her renown 
let darkness crown her with a starrier crown 
and let her watch the fierce waves crouch and fawn 
round those huge hulks from which her cannon frown 
while close inshore the wet seamists are drawn 
round englands drake then wait in triumph for the dawn 
the sun of rome goes down the night is dark 
still are her thousands praying still their cry 
ascends from the wide waste of waters hark 
ave maria darker grows the sky 
ave maria those about to die 
salute thee nay what wandering winds blaspheme 
with random gusts of chilling prophecy 
against the solemn sounds that heavenward stream 
the night is come at last break not the splendid dream 
but through the misty darkness close inshore 
northwest southwest and ever westward strained 
the little ships of england all night long 
as down the coast the reddening beacons leapt 
the crackle and lapping splash of tacking keels 
the bosuns low sharp whistles and the whine 
of ropes mixing with many a seabirds cry 
disturbed the darkness waking vague swift fears 
among the mighty hulks of spain that lay 
nearest then fading through the mists inshore 
northwest then growing again but farther down 
their ranks to westward with each dark return 
and dark departure till the rearmost rank 
of grim seacastles heard the swish and creak 
pass plashing seavvard thro the wet seamists 
to windward now of all that monstrous host 
then heard no more than wandering seabirds cries 
wheeling around their leagues of lanthornlight 
or heave of waters waiting for the dawn 
dawn everlasting and almighty dawn 
rolled oer the waters the frej mists were fled 
see in their reeking heavenwide crescent drawn 
those masts and spars and cloudy sails outspread 
like one great sulphurous tempest soaked with red 
in vain withstand the march of brightening skies 
the dawn sweeps onward and the night is dead 
and lo to windward what bright menace lies 
what glory kindles now in englands wakening eyes 
there on the glittering plains of open sea 
to windvard now behind the fleets of spain 
two little files of ships arc tossing free 
free of the winds and of the windswept main 
were they not trapped who brought them forth iigain 
free of the great new fields of englands war 
with sails like blossoms shining after rain 
and guns that sparkle to the morning star 
drake  first upon the deep that rolls to trafalgar 
and spain knows well that flag of fiery fame 
spain knows who leads those files across the sea 
implacable invincible his name 
el draque creeps hissing through her ranks to lee 
but now she holds the rolling heavens in fee 
his ships are few they surge across the foam 
the hunt is up but need the mountains flee 
or fear the snarling wolf pack let them come 
they crouch but dare not leap upon the flanks of rome 
nearer thej come and nearer nay prepare 
close your huge ranks that sweep from sky to sky 
madness itself would shrink but  will dare 
eternal hell let the great signal fly  
close up our ranks el draque comes down to die 
el draque is brave  the vast seacities loom 
thro heaven spain spares one smile of chivalry 
one wintry smile across her cannons gloom 
as that frail fleet fullsail comes rushing towrds its doom 
suddenly as the wild change of a dream 
even as the spaniards watched those lean sharp prows 
leap straight at their huge hulks watched well content 
knowing their foes once grappled must be doomed 
even as they caught the rush and hiss of foam 
across that narrow dwindling gleam of sea 
and heard abruptly close the sharp commands 
and steady british answers caught one glimpse 
of barearmed seamen waiting by their guns 
the vision changed the ships of england swerved 
swiftly  a volley of flame and thunder swept 
blinding the buffeted air a volley of iron 
from four sheer broadsides crashing thro a hulk 
of spain she reeled blind in the fiery surge 
and fury of that assault so swift it seemed 
that as she heeled to leeward ere her guns 
trained on the foe once more the sulphurous cloud 
that wrapped the sea once twice and thrice again 
split with red thunderclaps that rent and raked 
her huge beams through and through ay as she heeled 
to leeward still her own grim cannon belched 
their lava skyward wounding the void air 
and as by miracle the ships of  
were gone along the spanish rear they swept 
from north to south raking them as they went 
at close range hardly a pistolshot away 
with volley on volley never spain had seen 
seamen or marksmen like to these who sailed 
two knots against her one they came and went 
suddenly neared or sheered away at will 
as if by magic pouring flame and iron 
in four full broadsides thro some spanish hulk 
ere one of hers burst blindly at the sky 
southward along the spanish rear they swept 
then swung about and volleying sheets of flame 
iron and death along the same fierce road 
littered with spars reeking with sulphurous fumes 
returned triumphantly rushing all their sails 
alow aloft fullbellied with the wind 
then then from sky to sky one nukhty surge 
of baleful pride liiioe wratli storiny disduiii 
with sluidderinp clouds and towers of sail would urpje 
onward the heavinj citadels of spain 
which drasefl earths thunders oer the groaning main 
and held the panoplies of faith in fee 
beating against the wind struggling in vain 
to close with tliat swift oceancavalry 
spain had all earth in charge had england then the sea 
spain had the mountains  mountains flow like clouds 
spain had great kingdoms  kingdoms melt away 
yet in that crescent army on army crowds 
how shall she fear what seas or winds can say  
the seas that leap and shine round earths decay 
the nds that mount and sing while empires fall 
and mountains pass like waves in the winds way 
and dying gods thro shuddering twilights call 
had england then the sea that sweeps oer one and all 
see in gigantic wrath the rata hurls 
her mighty prows round to the wild sea wind 
the deep like one black maelstrom round her swirls 
while great recald follows hard behind 
reeling like titans thunderblasted blind 
they strive to cross the ships of england  yea 
challenge them to the grapple and only find 
red broadsides bursting oer the bursting spray 
and england surging still along her windward way 
to windward still revenge and raleigh flash 
and thunder and the sea flames red between 
in vain against the wind the galleons crash 
and plunge and pour blind volleys thro the screen 
of rolling sulphurous clouds at dimly seen 
topsails that to and fro like seabirds fly 
ever to leeward the great hulks careen 
their thousand cannon can but wound the sky 
while englands little rainbow foams and flashes by 
suddenly the flagship of recald stung 
to fury it seemed heeled like an avalanche 
to leeward then reeled out beyond the rest 
against the wind alone daring the foe 
to grapple her at once the little revenge 
with drakes flag flying flashed at her throat 
and hardly a cableslength away outbelched 
broadside on broadside under those great cannon 
crashing through fivefoot beams four shots to one 
while howard and the rest swept to and fro 
keeping at deadly bay the rolling hulks 
that looming like leviathans now plunged 
desperately against the freshening wind 
to rescue the great flagship where she lay 
alone amid the cannonades of drake 
alone like a volcanic island lashed 
with crimson hurricanes dinning the winds 
with isolated thunders flaking the skies 
with wrathful lava while great spars and blocks 
leapt through the cloudy glare and feu far off 
and so they came 
at dead of night on callao de lima 
they saw the harbour lights across the waves 
glittering and the shadowy hulks of ships 
gathered together like a flock of sheep 
within the port with shouts and clink of chains 
a shadowy ship was entering from the north 
and like the shadow of that shadow slipped 
the golden hyndc beside her thro the gloom 
and side by side they anchored in the port 
amidst the shipping over the dark tide 
a small boat from the customshouse drew near 
a sleepy yawning goldlaced officer 
boarded the golden hynde and with a cry 
stumbling against a cannonbutt he saw 
the barearmed british seamen in the gloom 
all waiting by their guns wildly he plunged 
over the side and urged his boat away 
crying el draque el draque at that dread word 
the darkness filled with clamour and the ships 
cutting their cables drifted here and there 
in mad attempts to seek the open sea 
wild lights burnt hither and thither and all the port 
one furnace of confusion licavcd and seethed 
in terror for each shadow of the night 
nay the great night itself was all kl draquc 
the dragons wings were spread from quay to quay 
the very lights that burnt from mast to mast 
and flared across the tide kindled his breath 
to fire while here and there a british pinnace 
slipped softly thro the roaring gloom and glare 
ransacking ship by ship for each one thought 
a fleet had come upon them each gave up 
the struggle as each was boarded while elsewhere 
cannon to cannon friends bombarded friends 
yet not one ounce of treasure in callao 
they found for fourteen days before they came 
that greatest treasureship of spain with all 
the gorgeous harvest of that year had sailed 
for panama her ballast  silver bars 
her cargo  rubies emeralds and gold 
out through the clamour and the darkness out 
out to the harbour mouth the golden hynde 
steered by the iron soul of drake returned 
and where the way was blocked her cannon clove 
a crimson highway to the midnight sea 
then northward northward oer the jewelled main 
under the white moon like a storm they drove 
in quest of the cacafuego fourteen days 
her start was and at dawn the fair wind sank 
and chafing lay the golden hynde becalmed 
while on the hills the viceroy of peru 
marched down from lima with two thousand men 
and sent out four huge ships of war to sink 
or capture the fierce dragon loud laughed  
to see them creeping nigh urged with great oars 
then suddenly pause for none would be the first 
to close with him and ere they had steeled their hearts 
to battle a fair breeze broke out anew 
and northward sped the little golden hynde 
in quest of the lordliest treasureship of spain 
tj  
behind her lay a world in arms for now 
wrath and confusion clamoured for revenge 
from sea to sea spain claimed the pirates head 
from england and awaited his return 
with all her tortures and whereer he passed 
he sowed the dragons teeth and everywhere 
cadmean broods of armed men arose 
and followed followed on his fiery trail 
men toiled at lima to fit out a fleet 
grim enough to destroy him all night long 
the flare went up from cities on the coast 
where men like naked devils toiled to cast 
cannon that might have overwhelmed the powers 
of michael when he drave that hideous rout 
through livid chaos to the black abyss 
small hope indeed there seemed of safe return 
but northward sped the little golden hynde 
the worldwatched midget ship of eighteen guns 
undaunted and upon the second dawn 
sighted a galleon not indeed the chase 
yet worth a pause for out of her they took  
embossed with emeralds large as pigeons eggs  
a golden crucifix with eighty pounds 
in weight of gold the rest they left behind 
and onward onward to the north they flew  
a score of golden miles a score of green 
an hundred miles eight hundred miles of foam 
rainbows and nre ransacking as they went 
ship after ship for news o the chase and gold 
learning from every capture that they drew 
nearer and nearer at truxillo dim 
and dreaming city adrowse with purple flowers 
she had paused ay paused to take a freight of gold 
at paita  she had passed two days in front 
only two days two days ahead nay one 
at quito close inshore a youthful page 
brighteyed ran up the rigging and cried a sail 
a sail  the cacafuego and the chain 
is mine  and by the strange cut of her sails 
whereof they had been told in callao 
they knew her 
heavily laden with her gems 
lazily drifting with her golden fruitage 
over the magic seas they saw her hull 
loom as they onward drew but drake for fear 
the prey might take alarm and run ashore 
trailed wineskins filled with water over the side 
to hold his ship back till the darkness fell 
and with the night the offshore wind arose 
at last the sun sank down tiie rosy light 
faded from andes jeaked and bosomed snow 
the nightwind rose the wineskins were uphauled 
and like a hound unleashed the golden ilynde 
leapt forward thro the gloom 
a cables length 
divided them the cacafucgo heard 
a rough voice in the darkness bidding her 
heave to she held her course  gave the word 
a broadside shattered the night and over her side 
her mainyard clattered like a broken wing 
on to her decks the british seadogs swarmed 
cutlass in hand that fight was at an end 
the ship was cleared a prize crew placed aboard 
then both ships turned their heads to the open sea 
at dawn being out of sight of land they gan 
examine the great prize none ever knew 
save  and gloriana what wild wealth 
they had captured there thus much at least was known 
an hundredweight of gold and twenty tons 
of silver bullion thirteen chests of coins 
nuggets of gold unnumbered countless pearls 
diamonds emeralds but the worth of these 
was past all reckoning in the crimson dawn 
ringed with the lonely pomp of sea and sky 
the nakedfooted seamen bathed kneedeep 
in gold and gathered up aladdins fruit  
allcolored gems  and tossed them in the sun 
the hold like one great elfin orchard gleamed 
with dusky globes and tawny glories piled 
hesperian apples heap on mellow heap 
rich with the hues of sunset rich and ripe

and xorthwnrd till the soft luxurious coasts 
hardened the winds grew bleak the great green waves 
loomed high like mountains round them and the spray 
froze on their spars and yards fresh from the warmth 
of tropic seas the men could hardly brook 
that cold and when the floating hills of ice 
like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow 
went past them with strange whispers in the gloom 
or took mysterious colours in the dawn 
their hearts misgave them and they found no way 
but all was iron shore and icy sea 
and one by one the crew fell sick to death 
in that fierce nnter and the land still ran 
westward and showed no passage tossed ith storms 
onward they plunged or furrowed gentler tides 
of icelit emerald that made the prow 
a faery beak of some enchanted ship 
flinging wild rainbows round her as she drove 
thro seas unsailed by mortal mariners 
past isles unhailed of any human voice 
where sound and silence mingled in one song 
of utter solitude ever as they went 
the flag of england blazoned the broad breeze 
northward where never ship had sailed before 
northward till lost in helpless wonderment 
dazed as a soul awakening from the dream 
of death to some wild dawn in paradise 
yet burnt with cold as they whose very tears 
freeze on their faces where cocytus wails 
all worldworn bruised wingbroken rtacked and wrenched 
blackened ith lightning scarred as with evil deeds 
but all embalmed in beauty by that sun 
which never sets bosomed m peace at last 
the gohien hynde rocked on a glittering calm 
seas that no ship had ever sailed from sky 
to glistening sky swept round them glory and gleam 
glamour and lucid rapture and diamond air 
embraced her broken spars begrimed with gold 
her gloomy hull rocking upon a sphere 
new made it seemed mysterious with the first 
mjstery of the world vrhere holy sky 
and sacred sea shone like the primal light 
of god astir with wliispeiinj seabirds wings 
and glorious with clouds only all day 
all night the rhythmic utterance of his will 
in the deep sigh of seas that washed his tiirone 
rose and relapsed across eternity 
timed to the pulse of leons all their world 
seemed strange as unto us the great new heavens 
and glittering shores if on some aery bark 
to saturns coasts we came and traced no more 
the tiny gleam of our familiar earth 
far oft but heard tremendous oceans roll 
round unimagined continents and saw 
terrible mountains unto which our alps 
were less than molehills and such gaunt raanes 
cleaving them and such cataracts roaring down 
as burst the gates of our earthmoulded senses 
pour the eternal glory on our souls 
and while ten thousand chariots bring the dawn 
hurl us poor midgets trembling to our knees 
glory and glamour and rapture of lucid air 
ice cold with subtle colours of the sky 
embraced her broken spars belted her hulk 
with brilliance while she dipped her jacinth beak 
in waves of mounded splendour and sometimes 
a great icemountain flashed and floated by 
throned on the waters pinnacled and crowned 
with all the smouldering jewels in the world 
or in the darkness glimmering berg on berg 
all emerald to the moon went by like ghosts 
whispering to the south 
there as they lay 
waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails 
their hearts remembered that in england now 
the spring was nigh and in that lonely sea 
the skilled musicians filled their eyes with home 
song 
it is the springtide now 
under the hawthornbough 
the milkmaid goes 
her eyes are violets blue 
washed with the morning dew 
her mouth a rose 
it is the springtide now 
the lanes are growing 
the lambkins frisk and bleat 
in all the meadows 
the glossy dappled kine 
blink in the warm sunshine 
cooling their shadows 
it is the springtide now 
ill 
soon hand in sunburnt hand 
thro gods green fairyland 
england our home 
whispering as they stray 
adown the primrose woy 
lovers will roam 
it is the springtide now 
and then with many a chain of linked sweetness 
harmonious gold they drew their hearts and soul 
back back to england thoughts of wife and child 
mother and sweetheart and the old companions 
the twisted streets of london and the deep 
delight of devon lanes all softly voiced 
in words or cadences made them breathe hard 
and gaze across the everlasting sea 
craving for that small isle so far away 
song 
 you beautiful land 
dccpbosomcd with beeches and bright 
with the flowery largesse of may 
sweet from the palm of her hand 
outflung till the hedges grew white 
as the greenarched billows with spray 
white from the fall of her feet 
the daisies awake in the sun  
cliffside and valley and plain 
with the breath of the thyme growing sweet 
laugh for the spring is begun 
and love hath turned homeward again 
 you beautiful land 
ill 
where should the home be of love 
but there where the hawthorntree blows 
and the milkmaid trips out with her pail 
and the skylark in heaven above 
sings till the west is a rose 
and the east is a nightingale 
 you beautiful land 
there where the sycamore trees 
are shading the satinskinned kine 
and oaks whose brethren of old 
conquered the strength of the seas 
grow broad in the sunlight and shine 
crowned with their cressets of gold 
 you bcaidiful land 
 draive 
deepbosomed with beeches and bright 
with rosecoloured cloudlets above 
billowing broad and grand 
wliere the meadows uith blossom are white 
for the footfall the footfall of love 
 ou beautiful land 
how should we sing of thy beauty 
england mother of men 
we that can look in thine eyes 
and see there the splendour of duty 
deep as the depth of their ken 
wide as the ring of thy skies 
vii 
 you beautifvl land 
deepbosomed with beeches and bright 
with the flowery largesse of may 
sweet from the palm of her hand 
outflung till the hedges grew ivhite 
as the greenarched billows with spray 
 you beautiful land 
and when a fair wind rose again there seemed 
no hope of passage by that fabled way 
northward and suddenly  put down his helm 
and with some wondrous purpose in his eyes 
turned southward once again until he found 
a lonely natural harbour on the coast 
near san francisco where the cliffs were white 
like those of england and the soft soil teemed 
with gold there they careened the golden hyndc  
her keel being thick with barnacles and weeds  
and built a fort and dockyard to refit 
tlieir little wandering home not half so large 
as many a coasting barque today that scarce 
would cross the channel yet she had swept the seas 
of half the world and even now jjrepared 
for nev adventures greater than them all 
and as the sound of chisel and hammer broke 
the stillness of that shore shy figures came 
keenfaced and graveeyed indians from the woods 
to bow before the strange whitefaced newcomers 
as gods whereat the chaplain all aghast 
persuaded them with signs and broken words 
and grunts that even  was but a man 
whom none the less the savages would crown 
with woven flowers and barbarous ritual 
king of new albion  so the seamen called 
that land remembering the white chffs of home 
imucli they implored with many a sign and cry 
which by the rescued slaves upon the prize 
were part interpreted that  would stay 
and rule them and the vision of the great 
impire of englishmen arose and flashed 
a moment round them on that lonely shore 
a small and weatherbeaten band they stood 
bronzed seamen by the laughing rescued slaves 
ringed with gigantic loneliness and saw 
an empire that should liberate the world 
a power before the lightning of whose arms 
darkness should die and all oppression cease 
a federation of the strong and weak 
whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong 
iade stronger in the increasing good of all 
a gathering up of one anothers loads 
a turning of the wasteful rage of war 
to accomphsh large and fruitful tasks of peace 
even as the strength of some great stream is turned 
to grind the corn for bread een thus on england 
that splendour dawned which those in dreams foresaw 
and saw not with their living eyes but thou 
england mayst lift up eyes at last and see 
 draie 
who like that angel of the apocalypse 
hast set one foot upon thy seagirt isle 
the other upon the waters and canst raise 
now if thou wilt above the assembled nations 
the trumpet of deliverance to thy lips 
at last their task was done the goldfn hynde 
undocked her white wings hoisted and away 
westward they swiftly glided from the shore 
where with a wild lament their indian friends 
kneedeep i the creaming foam all stood at gaze 
like men that for one moment in their lives 
have seen a mighty drama cross their path 
and played upon the stage of vast events 
knowing henceforward all their life is nought 
but westward sped the little golden hynde 
across the uncharted ocean with no guide 
but that great homing cry of all their hearts 
far out of sight of land they steered straight out 
across the great pacific in those days 
when even the compass proved no trusty guide 
straight out they struck in that small bark straight out 
week after week without one glimpse of aught 
but heaving seas across the uncharted waste 
straight to the sunset laughingly they sailed 
with all that gorgeous booty in their holds 
a splendour dragging deep through seas of doom 
a prey to the first great hurricane that blew 
except their god averted it and still 
their skilled musicians cheered the way along 
to shores bejond the sunset and the sea 
and oft at nights the yellow focsle lanthorn 
swung over swarthy singing faces grouped 
within the four small wooden walls that made 
their home and shut them from the unfathomable 
depths of mysterious gloom without that rolled 
all around them or tom moone would heartily troll 
a simple stave that struggled oft with thoughts 
beyond its reach yet reached their hearts no less 
song 
good luck befall you mariners all 
that sail this worhl so iridc 
whither ire go not yet we know 
ire steer by wind and tide 
be it right or wrong i sing this song 
for now it seems to mc 
men steer their soils thr  r cks and shoals 
as marinerc use by sea 
chorus as mariners use by sea 
my lads 
as mariners use by sea 
and now they plough to windward now 
they drive before the gale 
now are they hurled aeross the world 
with torn and tattered sail 
yet as they will they steer and still 
defy the worlds rude glee 
till death overwhelm them mast and helm 
they ride and rule the sea 
chorus they ride and rule the sea 
my lads 
they ride and rule the sea 
meantime in england bess of sydenham 
drakes love and queen being told that  was dead 
and numbed with grief obeying her fathers will 
that dreadful summer morn in bridal robes 
had passed to wed her fathers choice the sun 
streamed smiling on her as she went halfdazed 
amidst her smiling maids nigh to the sea 
the church was and the mellow marriage bells 
imixed with its music far away white sails 
spangled the sapphire white as flying blossoms 
newfallen from her crown but as the glad 
and sad procession neared the little church 
from some strange shipofwar far out at sea 
there came a sudden tiny puff of smoke  
and then a dull strange throb a whistling hiss 
and scarce a score of yards away a shot 
ploughed up the turf none knew none ever knew 
from whence it came whether a perilous jest 
of english seamen or a wanton deed 
of spaniards or mere accident but all 
her maids in flight were scattered bess awoke 
as from a dream crying aloud   tis he 
tis he that sends this message he is not dead 
i will not pass the porch come home with me 
twas he that sent that message 
nought availed 
her fathers wtath her mothers tears her maids 
cunning persuasions nought home she returned 
and waited for the dead to come to life 
nor waited long for ere that month was out 
rumour on rumour reached the coasts of england 
borne as it seemed on seabirds wings that  
was on his homeward way 
book vii 
the imperial tath of spain one worldwide sea 
of furious pomp and flouted power now surged 
all round this little isle with one harsh roar 
deepening for drakes return  the golden hynde 
ye swore had foundered  ye svvore was drowned 
they are on their homeward way the head of drake 
what answer what account what recompense 
now can ye yield our might invincible 
except the head of drake whose bloody deeds 
have reddened the pacific who hath sacked 
cities of gold burnt fleets and ruined realms 
what answer but his life 
to which the queen 
who saw the storm of europe slowly rising 
in avful menace oer her wavebeat throne 
and midmost of the storm the ensanguined robes 
of rome and murderous hand grasping the cross 
by its great hilt pointing it like a brand 
bloodllackened at the throat of england saw 
like skeleton castles wtapt in rolling mist 
the monstrous engines and designs of war 
the secret fleets and brooding panoplies 
philip prepared growing from day to day 
in dusk armipotent and embattled gloom 
surrounding her replied the life of drake 
if on our strict enquiry in due order 
we find that  have hurt our friends mark well 
if  have hurt our friends the life of drake 
and while the world awaited him as men 
might wait an earthquake quietly one grey morn 
one grey october morn of mist and rain 
when all the vindowpanes in plymouth dripped 
with listless drizzle and only through her streets 
rumbled the deathcart with its dreary bell 
monotonously plangent for the plague 
had lately like a vampire sucked the veins 
of plymouth town a little weedclogged ship 
grey as a ghost glided into the sound 
and anchored scarce a soul to see her come 
and not an eye to read the faded scroll 
around her battered prow  the golden hyndc 
then thro the dumb grey misty listless port 
a rumour like the colours of the dawn 
streamed oer the shining quajs up the wet streets 
in at the tavern doors flashed from the panes 
and turned them into diamonds fired the pools 
in every muddy lane with spanish gold 
flushed in a thousand faces  is come 
down every crowding alley the urchins leaped 
tossing their caps the golden hynde is come 
fisherman citizen prentice dame and maid 
fat justice floury baker bloated butcher 
fishwife minister and apothecary 
yea even the driver of the deathcart leaving 
his ghastly load using his dreary bell 
to merrier purpose down the seething streets 
panting tumbling jostling helterskelter 
to the waterside to the waterside they rushed 
and some kneedeep beyond it all one wild 
welcome to francis drake 
wild kerchiefs fluttering thunderous hurrahs 
rolling from quay to quay a thousand arms 
outstretched to that grey ghostly little ship 
at whose masthead the british flag still flew 
then over all in one tumultuous tide 
of pealing joy the plymouth bells outclashed 
a nations welcome home to francis drake 
the very golden hynde no idle dream 
the little ship that swept the spanish main 
carelessly lying there in plymouth sound 
the golden hynde the wonder of the world 
a glory wrapt her greyness and no boat 
dared yet approach save one with drakes close friends 
who came to warn him england stands alone 
and  is made the price of englands peace 
the queen perforce must temporise with spain 
the invincible she hath forfeited thy life 
to spain against her will only by this 
rejection of thee as a privateer 
she averted instant war for now the menace 
of spain draws nigher looms darker every hour 
the world is made spains footstool philip the king 
een now hath added to her boundless power 
without a blow the vast domains and wealth 
of portugal and deadlier yet a coast 
that crouches over against us cadiz holds 
a huge armada none knows where to strike 
and even this day a flying horseman brought 
rumours that spain hath landed a great force 
in ireland mary of scotland only waits 
the word to stab us in the side for rome 
the queen weighed down by burleigh nnd tlie friends 
of peace at any cost may yet be driven 
to make thy life our ransom which indeed 
she liatii already sworn or seemed to swear 
to whom  answered gloriana lives 
and in her life mine only fear lies dead 
mine only fear for luigland not myself 
willing am i and glad as  have lived 
to die for englands sake 
yet lest the queen be driven now to restore 
this cargo that i bring her  a worlds wealth 
the golden sjrings of all the power of spain 
the jewelled hearts of all those cruel realms 
for i have plucked them out beyond the sea 
lest she be driven to yield them up again 
for spain and spains delight i will warp out 
behind st nicholas island the fierce plague 
in plymouth shall be colour and excuse 
until my courier return from court 
with glorianas will if it be death 
ill out again to sea strew its rough floor 
with costlier largesses than kings can throw 
and ere i die will singe the spaniards beard 
and set the fringe of his imperial robe 
blazing along his coasts then let him roll 
his galleons round the little golden hynde 
bring her to bay if he can on the high seas 
ring us about with thousands well not yield 
i and my golden hynde we will go down 
with flag still flying on the last stump left us 
and all my cannon spitting out the fires 
of everlasting scorn into his face 
so  warped out the golden hijnde anew 
behind st nicholas island she lay there 
the small greygolden centre of the world 
that raged all round her the last hope the star 
of protestant freedom she the outlawed ship 
holding within her the great head and heart 
of englands ocean power and all tlie fleets 
that have enfranchised earth in that small ship 
lay waiting for their doom 
past her at night 
fisherboats glided wondering as they heard 
in the thick darkness the great songs they deemed 
must oft have risen from many a lonely sea 
for oft had spaniards brought a rumour back 
of that strange pirate who in royal state 
sailed to a sound of violins and dined 
with skilled musicians round him turning all 
battle and storm and death into a song 
song 
the same sun is oer us 
the same love shall find us 
the same and none other 
wherever we be 
with the same hope before us 
the same home behind us 
england our mother 
ringed round with the sea 
no land in the ring of it 
now all around us 
only the splendid 
resurging unknown 
how should we sing of it 
this that hath found us 
by the great stars attended 
at midnight alone 
our highway none knoweth 
yet our blood hath discerned it 
clear clear is our path now 
wliose foreheads are free 
where the hurricane bloweth 
our spirits have learned it 
tis the highway of wtath now 
the storms way the sea 
when the waters lay breathless 
gazing at hesper 
guarding that glorious 
fruitage of gold 
heard we the deathless 
wonderful whisper 
we follow victorious 
tonight as of old 
ah the broad miles of it 
white with the onset 
of waves without number 
warring for glee 
ah the soft smiles of it 
down to the sunset 
sacred for slumber 
the swans bath the sea 
when the breakers charged thundering 
in thousands all round us 
with a lightning of lances 
uphurtled on high 
when the stout ships were sundering 
a rapture hath crowned us 
like the wild light that dances 
on the crests that flash by 
our highway none knoweth 
yet our blood hath discerned it 
clear clear is our path now 
whose foreheads are free 
where euroclydon hlowelh 
our spirits have learned it 
tis the highway of wrath now 
the storm s way the sea 
who now will follow us 
where englands flag leadeth us 
where gold not inveigles 
nor statesmen betray 
tho the deep midnight swallow us 
let her cry when she needeth us 
we return her seaeagles 
the hurricanes way 
for the same sun is oer us 
the same love shall find us 
the same and none other 
wherever we he 
with the same hope before us 
the same home behind us 
england our mother 
ringed round with the sea 
so six days passed and on the seventh returned 
the courier with a message from the queen 
summoning  to court bidding him bring 
also such curious trifles of his voyage 
as might amuse her also be of good cheer 
she bade him and rest well content his life 
in glorianas hands were safe so  
laughingly landed with his warbronzed crew 
amid the wideeyed throng on plymouth beach 
and loaded twelve big packhorses with pearls 
beyond all price diamonds crosses of gold 
rubies that smouldered once for aztec kings 
and great dead incas gemencrusted crowns 
also he said well add a sack or twain 
of gold doubloons pieces of eight moidores 
and suchlike spanish trash for those poor lords 
at court lilies that toil not neither spin 
wherefore methinks their purses oft grow lean 
in these harsh times twere even as well their tongues 
wagged in our favour now as in our blame 
six days thereafter a fearful whisper reached 
mendoza plenipotentiary of spain 
in london that the pirate  was now 
in secret conference with the queen nay more 
that he the masterthief of the frjldcn world 
drake even he that bloody buccaneer 
had six hours audience with her majesty 
daily nay more walked with her in her garden 
alone among the fiery autumn leaves 
talking of god knows what and suddenly 
the temporizing diplomatic voice 
of caution he was wont to expect from england 
and blandl accept as his imperial due 
changed to a ringing key of firm resolve 
resistance nay defiance for when he came 
demanding audience of the queen behold 
her officers of state with mouths awry 
informed the high ambassador of spain 
despite his pomp and circumstance the queen 
could not receive him being in conference 
with some rough seaman pirate what you will 
a fellow made of bronze a buccaneer 
maned like a lion bearded like a pard 
with hammered head clamped jaws and great deep eyes 
that burned with fierce blue colours of the brine 
and liked not spain  drake twas the very name 
one francis drake a titan that had stood 
thundering commands against the thundering heavens 
on lightningshattered stormswept decks and drunk 
great draughts of glory from the rolling sea 
el draque el draque nor could she promise aught 
to spains ambassador nor see his face 
again while yet one spanish musketeer 
remained in ireland 
vainly the spaniard raged 
of restitution recompense for now 
had  brought up the little golden ilynde 
to london and the rumor of her wealth 
outtopped the wild reality the crew 
were princes as they swaggered down the streets 
in weatherbeaten splendour out of their doors 
to wonder and stare the jostling citizens ran 
when they went by and through the length and breadth 
of england now the gathering glory of life 
shone like the dawn oer hill and dale it streamed 
dawn everlasting and almighty dawn 
making a golden pomp of every oak  
had not its british brethren swept the seas  
in each remotest hamlet by the hearth 
the cart the grey churchporch the village pump 
by meadow and mill and old manorial hall 
by turnpike and by tavern farm and forge 
men staved the crimson vintage of romance 
and held it up against the light and drank it 
and with it drank confusion to the wrath 
that menaced england but eternal honour 
while blood ran in their veins to francis drake 
book viii 
meanwhile young bess of sydenham the queen 
of drakes deep heart emprisoned in her home 
fenced by her fathers angry watch and ward 
lest he  the poor plebeian dread of spain 
shaker of nations king of the untamed seas  
might win some word with her sweet bess the flower 
triumphant oer their rusty heraldries 
waited her lover as in ancient tales 
the pale princess from some grey wizards tower 
midmost the deep sigh of enchanted woods 
looks for the starry flash of her knights shield 
or on the further side o the magic west 
sees pushing through the ethereal golden gloom 
some blurred black prow with loaded colours coarse 
clouded with sunsets of a mortal sea 
and rich with earthly crimson she with lips 
apart still waits the shattering golden thrill 
when it shall grate the coasts of fairyland 
only to bess of sydenham there came 
no sight or sound to break that frozen spell 
and lonely watch no message from her love 
or none that reached her restless helpless hands 
only the general rumour of the world 
borne to her by the gossip of her maid 
kept the swift pictures passing througli her brain 
of how the golden hynde was hauled ashore 
at deptford through a sea of exultation 
and by the queens command was now set up 
for an everlasting memory 
of how the queen with subtle statecraft still 
kept spain at armslength dangling while she played 
at fast and loose with france whosc embassy 
arriving with the marriagetreaty found 
and trembled at her daring since the wtath 
of spain seemed in their eyes to flake with foam 
the stormbeat hulk a gorgeous banquet spread 
to greet them on that ver golden hynde 
which sacked the spanish main a gorgeous feast 
the like of which old england had not seen 
since the bluff days of boisterous king hal 
great shields of brawn with mustard roasted swans 
haunches of venison roasted chines of beef 
and chewets baked big olivepyes thereto 
and sallets mixed with sugar and cinnamon 
white vine rosewater and candied eringoes 
there on the outlawed ship whose very name 
rang like a blasphemy in the imperial ears 
of spain its every old wormeaten plank 
being scored with scorn and courage that not storm 
nor death nor all their inquisition racks 
the whitehot irons and bloody branding whips 
that scarred the backs of ptomes pale galleyslaves 
her captured english seamen ever could daunt 
there with huge empires waiting for one word 
one breath of colour and excuse to leap 
like wolves at the naked throat of her small isle 
there in the eyes of the staggered world she stood 
great gloriana while the live decks reeled 
with flash of jewels and flush of rustling silks 
she stood wath drake the corsair and her people 
surged like a sea around there did she give 
open defiance wath her agate smile 
to spain behold this pirate now she cried 
whose head my lord the invincible philip of spain 
demands from england kneel dowai master drake 
kneel down for now have i this gilded sword 
wherewith to strike it off nay thou my lord 
ambassador of france since i be woman 
and squeamish at the sight of blood give thou 
the accolade with that jest she gave the hilt 
thus even in boldness playing a crafty part 
and dangling france before the adventurous deed 
to marchaumont and in the face of europe 
with that huge fleet in cadiz and the whole 
worldpower of spain crouching around her isle 
knighted the masterthief of the unknown world 
sir francis drake 
and then the rumour came 
of vaster privateerings planned by  
against the coasts of philip but held in check 
and fretting at the leash as ever the queen 
clung to her statecraft while drakes enemies 
worked in the dark against him spain had set 
an emperors ransom on his life at home 
john doughty treacherous brother of that traitor 
who met his doom by drakes own hand intrigued 
with spain abroad and spains dark emissaries 
at home to avenge his brother burleigh still 
beset drakes path with pitfalls treacherous greed 
for spains bloodmoney daggered all the dark 
around him and john doughty without cease 
sought to make use of all until by chance 
 gat the proof of treasonable intrigue 
with spain against him up to the deadly hilt 
and hurled him into the tower 
many a night 
she sat by that old casement nigh the sea 
and heard its ebb and flow with soul erect 
and splendid now she waited yet there came 
no message and she thought he hath seen at last 
my little worth and when her maiden sang 
with white throat throbbing softly in the dusk 
and fingers gently straying oer the lute 
as was her wont at twilight some old song 
of high disdainful queens and lovers pale 
pining a thousand years before their feet 
see they come post haste from thanet
lovely couple side by side
theyve left behind them richard kennet
with the parents of the bride 
canterbury they have passed through
next succeeded stamfordbridge
chilham village they came fast through
now theyve mounted yonder ridge 
down the hill theyre swift proceeding
now they skirt the park around
lo the cattle sweetly feeding
scamper startled at the sound 
run my brothers to the pier gate
throw it open very wide
let it not be said that were late
in welcoming my uncles bride 
to the house the chaise advances
now it stopstheyre here theyre here
how dye do my uncle francis
how does do your lady dear 
miss lloyd has now sent to miss green
as on opening the box may be seen
some years of a black ploughmans gauze
to be made up directly because
miss lloyd must in mourning appear
for the death of a relative dear
miss lloyd must expect to receive
this license to mourn and to grieve
complete ere the end of the week
it is better to write than to speak 
happy the labrer in his sunday clothes
in lightdrab coat smart waistcoat welldarnd hose
andhat upon his head to church he goes
as oft with conscious pride he downward throws
a glance upon the ample cabbage rose
that stuck in buttonhole regales his nose
he envies not the gayest london beaux
in church he takes his seat among the rows
pays to the place the reverence he owes
likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows
lists to the sermon in a softening doze
and rouses joyous at the welcome close 
ever musing i delight to tread 
the paths of honour and the myrtle grove 
whilst the pale moon her beams doth shed 
on disappointed love 
while philomel on airy hawthorn bush 
sings sweet and melancholy and the thrush 
converses with the dove 
gently brawling down the turnpike road 
sweetly noisy falls the silent stream 
the moon emerges from behind a cloud 
and darts upon the myrtle grove her beam 
ah then what lovely scenes appear 
the hut the cot the grot and chapel queer 
and eke the abbey too a mouldering heap 
cnceald by aged pines her head doth rear 
and quite invisible doth take a peep 
oh mr best youre very bad
and all the world shall know it
your base behaviour shall be sung
by me a tunefull poet 
you used to go to harrowgate
each summer as it came
and why i pray should you refuse
to go this year the same 
the ways as plain the roads as smooth
the posting not increased
youre scarcely stouter than you were
not younger sir at least 
if eer the waters were of use
why now their use forego
you may not live another year
alls mortal here below 
it is your duty mr best
to give your health repair
vain else your richards pills will be
and vain your consorts care 
but yet a nobler duty calls
you now towards the north
arise ennobledas escort
of martha lloyd stand forth 
she wants your aidshe honours you
with a distinguished call
stand forth to be the friend of her
who is the friend of all 
take her and wonder at your luck
in having such a trust
her converse sensible and sweet
will banish heat and dust 
so short shell make the journey seem
youll bid the chaise stand still
twill be like driving at full speed
from newbry to speen hill 
convey her safe to mortons wife
and ill forget the past
and write some verses in your praise
as finely and as fast 
but if you still refuse to go
ill never let your rest
buy haunt you with reproachful song
oh wicked mr best    
ive a pain in my head 
said the suffering beckford 
to her doctor so dread 
oh what shall i take fort
said this doctor so dread 
whose name it was newnham 
for this pain in your head 
ah what can you do maam
said miss beckford suppose 
if you think theres no risk 
i take a good dose 
of calomel brisk
what a praise worthy notion 
replied mr newnham 
you shall have such a potion 
and so will i too maam
this little bag i hope will prove
to be not vainly made
for if you should a needle want
it will afford you aid 
and as we are about to part
twill serve another end
for when you look upon the bag
youll recollect your friend

love one another by khalil gibran aka kahlil jubran
love one another but make not a bond of love
let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls
fill each others cup but drink not from one cup
give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf
sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone
even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music
give your hearts but not into each others keeping
for only the hand of life can contain your hearts
and stand together yet not too near together
for the pillars of the temple stand apart
and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow
how do i love thee by elizabeth barrett browning
how do i love thee let me count the ways
i love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my soul can reach when feeling out of sight
for the ends of being and ideal grace
i love thee to the level of every days
most quiet need by sun and candlelight
i love thee freely as men strive for right
i love thee purely as they turn from praise
i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints i love thee with the breath
smiles tears of all my life and if god choose
i shall but love thee better after death
love poems for your boyfriend that will make him cry

bright star by john keats
bright star would i were stedfast as thou art
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
and watching with eternal lids apart
like natures patient sleepless eremite
the moving waters at their priestlike task
of pure ablution round earths human shores
or gazing on the new softfallen mask
of snow upon the mountains and the moors
noyet still stedfast still unchangeable
pillowd upon my fair loves ripening breast
to feel for ever its soft fall and swell
awake for ever in a sweet unrest
still still to hear her tendertaken breath
and so live everor else swoon to death
 bright star by john keats from famous deep love poetry collection for him
meeting at night by robert browning
the gray sea and the long black land
and the yellow halfmoon large and low
and the startled little waves that leap
in fiery ringlets from their sleep
as i gain the cove with pushing prow
and quench its speed i the slushy sand
then a mile of warm seascented beach
three fields to cross till a farm appears
a tap at the pane the quick sharp scratch
and blue spurt of a lighted match
and a voice less loud through joys and fears
than the two hearts beating each to each
my river by emily dickinson
my river runs to thee
blue sea wilt thou welcome me
my river awaits reply
oh sea look graciously
ill fetch thee brooks
from spotted nooks
say sea take me
deep meaningful love poems for him
loves philosophy by percy bysshe shelley
the fountains mingle with the river
and the rivers with the ocean
the winds of heaven mix for ever
with a sweet emotion
nothing in the world is single
all things by a law divine
in one spirit meet and mingle
why not i with thine
see the mountains kiss high heaven
and the waves clasp one another
no sisterflower would be forgiven
if it disdained its brother
and the sunlight clasps the earth
and the moonbeams kiss the sea
what is all this sweet work worth
if thou kiss not me

done with the compass 
done with the chart
rowing in eden 
ah the sea
might i moor  tonight 
in thee
deep love poems for him
poem to an unnameable man by dorothea lasky
you have changed me already i am a fireball
that is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
you can choose not to look up but i am a giant orange ball
that is throwing sparks upon your face
oh look at them shake
upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
o too this is so dramatic this shaking
of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
so you ran and hid
under a large tree she was graceful i think
that tree although soon she will wither
into ten black snakes upon your throat
and when she does i will be wandering as i always am
a graceful lady that is part museum
of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
i will hold your voice in a little box
and when you come upon me i wont look back at you
you will feel a hand upon your heart while i place your voice back
into the heart from where it came from
and i will not cry also
although you will expect me to
i was wiser too than you had expected
for i knew all along you were mine
romantic poems for him to make him cry
to my dear and loving husband by anne bradstreet
if ever two were one then surely we
if ever man were loved by wife then thee
if ever wife was happy in a man
compare with me ye women if you can
i prize thy love more than whole mines of gold
or all the riches that the east doth hold
my love is such that rivers cannot quench
nor ought but love from thee give recompense
thy love is such i can no way repay
the heavens reward thee manifold i pray
then while we live in love lets so persever
that when we live no more we may live ever
did you see poems about missing you collection
poem for my love by june jordan
how do we come to be here next to each other
in the night
where are the stars that show us to our love
inevitable
outside the leaves flame usual in darkness
and the rain
falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh
the black men waiting on the corner for
a womanly mirage
i am amazed by peace
it is this possibility of you
asleep
and breathing in the quiet air
most beautiful love poems for him
i love you by ella wheeler wilcox
i love your lips when theyre wet with wine
and red with a wild desire
i love your eyes when the lovelight lies
lit with a passionate fire
i love your arms when the warm white flesh
touches mine in a fond embrace
i love your hair when the strands enmesh
your kisses against my face
not for me the cold calm kiss
of a virgins bloodless love
not for me the saints white bliss
nor the heart of a spotless dove
but give me the love that so freely gives
and laughs at the whole worlds blame
with your body so young and warm in my arms
it sets my poor heart aflame
so kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth
still fragrant with ruby wine
and say with a fervor born of the south
that your body and soul are mine
clasp me close in your warm young arms
while the pale stars shine above
and well live our whole young lives away
in the joys of a living love
deep passionate love poems for him
remember by christina rossetti
remember me when i am gone away
gone far away into the silent land
when you can no more hold me by the hand
nor i half turn to go yet turning stay
remember me when no more day by day
you tell me of our future that you plannd
only remember me you understand
it will be late to counsel then or pray
yet if you should forget me for a while
and afterwards remember do not grieve
for if the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once i had
better by far you should forget and smile
than that you should remember and be sad
love and friendship by emily bronte
love is like the wild rosebriar
friendship like the hollytree
the holly is dark when the rosebriar blooms
but which will bloom most constantly
the wild rosebriar is sweet in spring
its summer blossoms scent the air
yet wait till winter comes again
and who will call the wildbriar fair
then scorn the silly rosewreath now
and deck thee with the hollys sheen
that when december blights thy brow
he still may leave thy garland green
sweet love poems for him that will make him cry
love by margaret atwood
this is a word we use to plug
holes with its the right size for those warm
blanks in speech for those red heart
shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing
like real hearts add lace
and you can sell
it we insert it also in the one empty
space on the printed form
that comes with no instructions there are whole
magazines with not much in them
but the word love you can
rub it all over your body and you
can cook with it too how do we know
it isnt what goes on at the cool
debaucheries of slugs under damp
pieces of cardboard as for the weed
seedlings nosing their tough snouts up
among the lettuces they shout it
love love sing the soldiers raising
their glittering knives in salute
then theres the two
of us this word
is far too short for us it has only
four letters too sparse
to fill those deep bare
vacuums between the stars
that press on us with their deafness
its not love we dont wish
to fall into but that fear
this word is not enough but it will
have to do its a single
vowel in this metallic
silence a mouth that says
o again and again in wonder
and pain a breath a finger
grip on a cliffside you can
hold on or let go
short deep love poems for him
the meeting by katherine mansfield
we started speaking
looked at each other then turned away
the tears kept rising to my eyes
but i could not weep
i wanted to take your hand
but my hand trembled
you kept counting the days
before we should meet again
but both of us felt in our hearts
that we parted for ever and ever
the ticking of the little clock filled the quiet room
listen i said it is so loud
like a horse galloping on a lonely road
as loud as a horse galloping past in the night
you shut me up in your arms
but the sound of the clock stifled our hearts beating
you said i cannot go all that is living of me
is here for ever and ever
then you went
the world changed the sound of the clock grew fainter
dwindled away became a minute thing
i whispered in the darkness if it stops i shall die
the kiss by sara teasdale
i hoped that he would love me
and he has kissed my mouth
but i am like a stricken bird
that cannot reach the south
for though i know he loves me
tonight my heart is sad
his kiss was not so wonderful
as all the dreams i had
famously gorgeous love poems for him thekissbysarateasdale
at last by elizabeth akers allen
at last when all the summer shine
that warmed lifes early hours is past
your loving fingers seek for mine
and hold them closeat lastat last
not oft the robin comes to build
its nest upon the leafless bough
by autumn robbed by winter chilled
but you dear heart you love me now
though there are shadows on my brow
and furrows on my cheek in truth
the marks where times remorseless plough
broke up the blooming sward of youth
though fled is every girlish grace
might win or hold a lovers vow
despite my sad and faded face
and darkened heart you love me now
i count no more my wasted tears
they left no echo of their fall
i mourn no more my lonesome years
this blessed hour atones for all
i fear not all that time or fate
may bring to burden heart or brow
strong in the love that came so late
our souls shall keep it always now
love poems for him that will make him cry
maud by alfred lord tennyson
a monodrama
come into the garden maud
for the black bat night has flown
come into the garden maud
i am here at the gate alone
and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad
and the musk of the rose is blown
for a breeze of morning moves
and the planet of love is on high
beginning to faint in the light that she loves
in a bed of daffodil sky
to faint in the light of the sun she loves
to faint in his light and to die
all night have the roses heard
the flute violin bassoon
all night has the casement jessamine stirrd
to the dancers dancing in tune
till a silence fell with the waking bird
and a hush with the setting moon
i said to the lily there is but one
with whom she has heart to be gay
when will the dancers leave her alone
she is weary of dance and play
now half to the setting moon are gone
and half to the rising day
low on the sand and loud on the stone
the last wheel echoes away
i said to the rose the brief night goes
in babble and revel and wine
o young lordlover what sighs are those
for one that will never be thine
but mine but mine so i sware to the rose
for ever and ever mine
and the soul of the rose went into my blood
as the music clashd in the hall
and long by the garden lake i stood
for i heard your rivulet fall
from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood
our wood that is dearer than all
from the meadow your walks have left so sweet
that whenever a marchwind sighs
he sets the jewelprint of your feet
in violets blue as your eyes
to the woody hollows in which we meet
and the valleys of paradise
the slender acacia would not shake
one long milkbloom on the tree
the white lakeblossom fell into the lake
as the pimpernel dozed on the lea
but the rose was awake all night for your sake
knowing your promise to me
the lilies and roses were all awake
they sighd for the dawn and thee
queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
come hither the dances are done
in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls
queen lily and rose in one
shine out little head sunning over with curls
to the flowers and be their sun
there has fallen a splendid tear
from the passionflower at the gate
she is coming my dove my dear
she is coming my life my fate
the red rose cries she is near she is near
and the white rose weeps she is late
the larkspur listens i hear i hear
and the lily whispers i wait
she is coming my own my sweet
were it ever so airy a tread
my heart would hear her and beat
were it earth in an earthy bed
my dust would hear her and beat
had i lain for a century dead
would start and tremble under her feet
and blossom in purple and red

busy old fool unruly sun
               why dost thou thus
through windows and through curtains call on us
must to thy motions lovers seasons run
               saucy pedantic wretch go chide
               late school boys and sour prentices
         go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride
         call country ants to harvest offices
love all alike no season knows nor clime
nor hours days months which are the rags of time
               thy beams so reverend and strong
               why shouldst thou think
i could eclipse and cloud them with a wink
but that i would not lose her sight so long
               if her eyes have not blinded thine
               look and tomorrow late tell me
         whether both th indias of spice and mine
         be where thou leftst them or lie here with me
ask for those kings whom thou sawst yesterday
and thou shalt hear all here in one bed lay
               shes all states and all princes i
               nothing else is
princes do but play us compared to this
all honors mimic all wealth alchemy
               thou sun art half as happy as we
               in that the worlds contracted thus
         thine age asks ease and since thy duties be
         to warm the world thats done in warming us
shine here to us and thou art everywhere
this bed thy center is these walls thy sphere
body of a woman 
body of a woman white hills white thighs 
you look like a world lying in surrender 
my rough peasants body digs into you 
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth 
i was alone like a tunnel the birds fled from me 
and night swamped me with its crushing invasion 
to survive myself i forged you like a weapon 
like an arrow in my bow a stone in my sling 
but the hour of vengeance falls and a love you 
body of skin of moss of eager and firm milk 
oh the goblets of the breast oh the eyes of absence 
oh the pink roses of the pubis oh your voice slow and 
sad  
body of my woman i will persist in your grace 
my thirst my boundless desire my shifting road 
dark riverbeds where the eternal thirst flows 
and weariness follows and the infinite ache 
the light wraps you 
the light wraps you in its mortal flame 
abstracted pale mourner standing that way 
against the old propellers of twilight 
that revolves around you 
speechless my friend 
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead 
and filled with lives of fire 
and pure heir of the ruined day 
a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment 
the great roots of night 
grow suddenly from your soul 
and the things that hide in you come out again 
so that a blue and pallid people 
your newly born takes nourishment 
oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave 
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold 
rise lead and possess a creation 
so rich in life that its flowers perish 
and it is full of sadness 
ill 
ah vastness of pines 
ah vastness of pines murmur of waves breaking 
slow play of lights solitary bell 
twilight falling in your eyes toy doll 
earthshell in whom the earth sings 
i n you 
as you 
aim my 
and in 
the rivers sing and my soul flees in them 
desire and you send it where you will 
road on your bow of hope 
a frenzy i will flee my flock of arrows 
on all sides i see your waist of fog 
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours 
my kisses anchor and my moist desire nests 
in your arms of transparent stone 
ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens 
in the resonant and dying evening 
thus in the deep hours i have seen over the fields 
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind 
the morning is full 
the morning is full of storm 
in the heart of summer 
the clouds travel like white handkerchiefs of goodbye the 
wind traveling waving them in its hands 
the numberless heart of the wind 
beating above our loving silence 
orchestral and divine resounding among the trees 
like a language full of wars and songs 
wind that bears off the dead leaves with a quick raid and 
deflects the pulsing arrows of the birds 
wind that topples her in a wave without spray 
and substance without weight and leaning fires 
her mass of kisses breaks and sinks 
assailed in the door of the summers wind 
so that you will hear me 
so that you will hear me 
my words 
sometimes grow thin 
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches 
necklace drunken bell 
for your hands as smooth as grapes 
and i watch my words from a long way off 
they are more yours than mine 
they climb on my old suffering ivy 
it climbs the same way on damp walls 
you are to blame for this cruel sport 
they are fleeing from my dark lair 
you fill everything you fill everything 
before you they are peopled in the solitude that you occupy 
and they are more used to my sadness than you are 
now i want them to say what i want to say to you 
and to make you hear as i wasnt you to hear me 
the winds of anguish still hauls on them as usual 
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over 
you listen to other voices in my painful voice 
lament of old mouths blood of old supplications 
love me companion dont forsake me follow me 
follow me companion on this wave of anguish 
but my words become stained with your love 
you occupy everything you occupy everything 
i am making them into an endless necklace 
for your white hands smooth as grapes 
i remember you as you were 
i remember you as you were last autumn 
you were the grey beret and the still heart 
in your eyes the flames of twilight fought on 
and the leaves fell on the water of your soul 
clasping my arms like a climbing plant 
the leaves garnered your voice that was slow and at peace 
bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning 
sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul 
i feel your eyes traveling and the autumn is far off grey 
beret voice of bird heart like a house 
towards which my deep longings migrated 
and my kisses fell happy as embers 
sky from a ship field from the hills 
your memory is made of light of smoke of a still pond 
beyond your eyes farther on the evenings were blazing 
dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul 
vii 
leaning into the afternoons 
leaning into the afternoons i cast my sad nets 
towards your oceanic eyes 
there in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames 
its arms turning like a drowning mans 
i sent out red signals across your absent eyes 
that move like the sea near a lighthouse 
you keep only darkness my distant female 
from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges 
leaning into the afternoons i fling my sad nets 
to the sea that beats on your marine eyes 
the birds peck at the first stars 
that flash like my soul when i love you 
the night on its shadowy mare 
shedding blue tassels over the land 
viii 
white bee 
white bee you buzz in my soul drunk with honey 
and your flight winds in slow spirals of smoke 
i am the one without hope the word without echoes 
he who lost everything and he who had everything 
last hawser in you creaks my last longing 
in my barren land you are the final rose 
ah you who are silent 
let your deep eyes close there the night flutters 
ah your body a frightened statue naked 
you have deep eyes in which the night flails 
cool arms of flowers and a lap of rose 
your breasts seem like white snails 
a butterfly of shadow has come to sleep in your belly 
ah you who are silent 
here is the solitude from which you are absent 
it is raining the sea wind is hunting stray gulls 
the water walks barefoot in the wet streets 
from that tree the leaves complain as though they were sick 
white bee even when you are gone you buzz in my soul 
you live again in time slender and silent 
ah you who are silent 
drunk with pines 
drunk with pines and long kisses 
like summer i steer the fast sail of roses 
bent towards the death of the thin day 
stuck into my solid marine madness 
pale and lashed to my ravenous water 
i cruise in the sour smell of the naked climate 
still dressed in grey and bitter sounds 
and a sad crest of abandoned spray 
hardened by passions i go mounted on my one wave 
lunar solar burning and cold all at once 
becalmed in the throat of fortunate isles 
that are white and sweet as cool hips 
in the moist night my garment of kisses trembles 
charged to insanity with electric currents 
heroically dividing into dreams 
and intoxicating roses practising on me 
upstream in the midst of the outer waves 
your parallel body yields to my arms 
like a fish infinitely fastened to my soul 
quick and slow in the energy under the sky 
we have lost even 
we have lost even this twilight 
no one saw us this evening hand in hand 
while the blue night dropped out of the world 
i have seen from my window 
the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops 
sometimes a piece of sun 
burned like a coin between my hands 
i remembered you with my soul clenched 
in the sadness of mine that you know 
where were you then 
who else was there 
saying what 
why will the whole of love come on me suddenly 
when i have sad and feel you are far away 
the book fell that is always turned to at twilight 
and my cape rolled like a hurt dog at my feet 
always always you recede through the evenings 
towards where the twilight goes erasing statues 
almost out of sky 
almost out of the sky half of the moon 
anchors between two mountains 
turning wandering night the digger of eyes 
lets see how many stars are smashed in the pool 
it makes a cross of mourning between my eyes and runs away 
forge of blue metals nights of stilled combats 
my heart revolves like a crazy wheel 
girl who have from so far brought me so far 
sometimes you glance flashes out under the sky 
rumbling storm cyclone of fury 
you cross above my heart without stopping 
wind from the tombs carries off wrecks scatters your 
sleepy root

the big trees on the other side of her uprooted 
but you cloudless girl question of smoke corn tassel 
you were what the wind was making with illuminated leaves 
behind the nocturnal mountains white lily of conflagration 
ah i can say nothing you were made of everything 
longing that sliced my breast into pieces 
it is time to take another road on which she does not 
smile

storm that buried the bells muddy swirl of torments 
why touch her now why make her sad 
oh to follow the road that leads away from everything 
without anguish death winter waiting along it 
with their eyes open through the dew 
xii 
your breast is enough 
your breast is enough for my heart 
and my wings for your freedom 
what was sleeping above your soul will rise 
out of my mouth to heaven 
in you is the illusion of each day 
you arrive like the dew to the cupped flowers 
you undermine the horizon with your absence 
eternally in flight like the wave 
i have said that you sang in the wind 
like the pines and like the masts 
like them you are tall and taciturn 
and you are sad all at once like a voyage 
you gather things to you like an old road 
you are peopled with echoes and nostalgic voices 
i awoke and at times the birds fled and migrated 
that had been sleeping in your soul 
xiii 
i have gone marking 
i have gone marking the atlas of your body 
with crosses of fire 
my mouth went across a spider trying to hide 
in you behind you timid driven by thirst 
stories to tell you on the shore of the evening 
sad and gentle doll so that you should not be sad 
a swan a tree something far away and happy 
the season of grapes the ripe and fruitful season 
i who lived in a harbour from which i loved you 
the solitude crossed with dream and with silence 
penned up between the sea and sadness 
soundless delirious between two motionless gondoliers 
between the lips and the voice something goes dying 
something with the wings of a bird something of anguish and 
oblivion

the way nets cannot hold water 
my toy doll only a few drops are left trembling 
even so something sings in these fugitive words 
something sings something climbs to my ravenous mouth 
oh to be able to celebrate you with all the words of joy 
sing burn flee like a belfry at the hands of a madman 
my sad tenderness what comes over you all at once 
when i have reached the most awesome and the coldest summit 
my heart closes like a nocturnal flower 
xiv 
every day you play 
every day you play with the light of the universe 
subtle visitor you arrive in the flower and the water 
you are more that this white head that i hold tightly 
as a cluster of fruit every day between my hands 
you are like nobody since i love you 
let me spread you out among the yellow garlands 
who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of 
the south 
oh let me remember you as you were before you existed 
suddenly the wind howls and bangs my shut window 
the sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish 
here all the winds will let go sooner or later all of them 
the rain takes off her clothes 
the birds go by fleeing 
the wind the wind 
i can contend only against the power of men 
the storm whirls dark leaves 
and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to 
the sky 
you are here oh you do not run away 
you will answer me to the last cry 
cling to me as though you were frightened 
even so at one time a strange shadow ran through your eyes 
now now too little one you bring me honeysuckle 
and even your breasts smell of it 
while the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies 
i love you and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth 
how you must have suffered against getting accustomed to me 
my savage solitary soul my name that sends them all 
running

so many times have we seen the morning star burn kissing 
our eyes 
and over our heads the grey light unwind in turning fans 
my words rained over you stroking you 
a long time i have loved the sunned motherofpearl of your 
body

i go so far as to think you own the universe 
i will bring you happy flowers from the mountains 
bluebells 
dark hazels and rustic baskets of kisses 
i want 
to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees 
i like for you to be still 
i like for you to be still i as though you were absent 
and you do not hear me far away and my voice does not touch 
you

it seems as though your eyes had flown away 
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth 
as all things are filled with my soul 
you emerge from the things filled with my soul 
you are like my soul a butterfly of dream 
and you are like the word melancholy 
i like for you to be still and you are still far away 
it sounds as though you were lamenting a butterfly cooing 
like a dove

and you hear me from far away and my voice does not reach 
you  
let me come to be still in you silence 
and let me talk to you with your silence 
that is bright as a lamp simple as a ring 
you are like the night with its stillness and 
constellations

your silence is that of a star as remote and candid 
i like for you to be still it is though you were absent 
distant and full of sorrow as though you had died 
one word then one smile is enough 
and i am happy happy that its not true 
xvi 
in my sky as twilight 
in my sky at twilight you are like a cloud 
and your form and colour are the way i love them 
you are mine mine woman with sweet lips 
and in your life my infinite dreams live 
the lamp of my soul dyes your feet 
my sour wine is sweeter than your lips 
oh reaper of my evening song 
how solitary dreams believe you to be mine 
you are mine mine i go shouting it to the afternoon 
wind and the wind hauls on my widowed voice 
huntress of the depths of my eyes your plunder 
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water 
you are taken in the net of my music my love 
and my nets of music are wide as the sky 
my soul is borne on the shore of your eyes of mourning 
in your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begins 
xvii 
thinking tangling shadows 
thinking  tangling shadows in the deep solitude 
you are far away too oh farther than anyone 
thinking freeing birds dissolving images 
burying lamps 
belfry of fogs how far away up there 
stifling laments milling shadowy hopes 
taciturn miller 
night falls on you face downward far from the city 
your presence is foreign as strange as a thing 
i think i explore great tracts of my life before you 
my life before anyone my harsh life 
the shout facing the sea among the rocks 
running free mad in the seaspray 
the sad rage the shout the solitude of the sea 
headlong violent stretched towards the sky 
you woman what were you there what ray what vane 
of that immense fan you were as far as you are now 
fire in the forest burn in blue crosses 
burn burn flame up sparkle in trees of light 
it collapses crackling fire fire 
and my soul dances seared with curls of fire 
who calls what silence peopled with echoes 
hour of nostalgia hour of happiness hour of solitude 
hour that is mine from among them all 
hunting horn through which the wind passes singing 
such a passion of weeping tied to my body 
shaking of all the roots 
attack of all the waves 
my soul wandered happy sad unending 
thinking burying lamps in the deep solitude 
who are you who are you 
xviii 
here i love you 
here i love you 
in the dark pines the wind disentangles itself 
the moon glows like phosphorus on the vagrant waters 
days all one kind go chasing each other 
the snow unfurls in dancing figures 
a silver gull slips down from the west 
sometimes a sail high high stars 
oh the black cross of a ship 
alone

sometimes i get up early and my soul is wet 
far away the sea sounds and resounds 
this is a port

here i love you 
here i love you and the horizon hides you in vain 
i love you still among these cold things 
sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels 
that cross the sea towards no arrival 
i see myself forgotten like those old anchors 
the piers sadden when the afternoon moors there 
my life grows tired hungry to no purpose 
i love what i do not have you are so far 
my loathing wrestles with the slow twilights 
but night comes on and starts to sing to me 
the moon turns its clockwork dream 
the biggest stars look at me with your eyes 
and as i love you the pines in the wind 
want to sing your name with their leaves of wire 
xix 
girl lithe and tawny 
girl lithe and tawny the sun that forms 
the fruits that plumps the grains that curls seaweeds 
filled your body with joy and your luminous eyes 
and your mouth that has the smile of water 
a black yearning sun is braided into the strands 
of your black mane when you stretch your arms 
you play with the sun as with a little brook 
and it leaves two dark pools in your eyes 
girl lithe and tawny nothing draws me towards you 
everything bears me farther away as though you were noon 
you are the frenzied youth of the bee 
the drunkenness of the wave the power of the wheatear 
my somber heart searches for you nevertheless 
and i love your joyful body your slender and flowing voice 
dark butterfly sweet and definitive 
like the wheatfield and the sun the poppy and the water 
tonight i can write 
tonight i can write the saddest lines 
write for example the night is starry 
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance 
the night wind revolves in the sky and sings 
tonight i can write the saddest lines 
i loved her and sometimes she loved me too 
through nights like this one i held her in my arms 
i kissed her again and again under the endless sky 
she loved me and sometimes i loved her too 
how could i not have loved her great still eyes 
tonight i can write the saddest lines 
to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost 
her

to hear the immense night still more immense without her 
and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture 
what does it matter that my love could not keep her 
the night is starry and she is not with me 
this is all in the distance someone is singing in the 
distance

my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her 
my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer 
my heart looks for her and she is not with me 
the same night whitening the same trees 
we of that time are no longer the same 
i no longer love her thats for certain but how i loved 
her

my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing 
anothers she will be anothers as she was before my 
kisses

her voice her bright body her infinite eyes 
i am no longer in love with her thats certain but maybe i 
love her

love is so short forgetting is so long 
because through nights like this one i held her in my arms 
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her 
though this be the last pain she makes me suffer 
and these the last verses that i write for her 
the song of despair 
the memory of you emerges from the night around me 
the river mingles in its stubborn lament with the sea 
deserted like the wharves at dawn 
it is the hour of departure oh deserted one 
cold flower heads are raining in my heart 
oh pit of debris fierce cave of the shipwrecked 
in you the wars and the flights accumulated 
from you the wings of the song birds rose 
you swallowed everything like distance 
like the sea like time in you everything sank 
it was the happy hour of assault and the kiss 
the hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse 
pilots dread fury of a blind driver 
turbulent drunkenness of love in you everything sank 
in the childhood of mist my soul winged and wounded 
lost discoverer in you everything sank 
you girdled sorrow you clung to desire 
sadness stunned you in you everything sank 
i made the wall of shadow draw back 
beyond desire and act i walked on 
oh flesh my own flesh woman that i loved and lost 
i summon you in the moist hour i raise my song to you 
like a jar you housed the infinite tenderness 
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar 
there was the black solitude of the islands 
and there woman of love your arms took me in 
there were thirst and hunger and you were the fruit 
there were grief and ruins and you were the miracle 
ah woman i do not know how you could contain me 
in the earth of your soul in the cross of your arms 
how horrible and brief was my desire of you 
how difficult and drunken how tensed and avid 
cemetery of kisses there is still fire in your tombs 
still the fruited boughs burn pecked at by birds 
oh the bitter mouth oh the kissed limbs 
oh the hungering teeth oh the entwined bodies 
oh the mad coupling of hope and force 
in which we merged and despaired 
and the tenderness light as water and as flour 
and the word scarcely begun on the lips 
this was my destiny and in it was the voyage of my longing 
and in it my longing fell in you everything sank 
oh pit of debris everything fell into you 
what sorrow did you not express in what sorrow are you not 
drowned  
from billow to billow you still called and sang 
standing like a sailor on the prow of the vessel 
you still flowered in songs you still broke in currents 
oh pit of debris open and bitter well 
pale blind diver luckless slinger 
lost discoverer in you everything sank 
it is the hour of departure the hard cold hour 
in which the night fastens to all timetables 
the rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore 
cold stars heave up black birds migrate 
deserted like the wharves at dawn 
only the tremulous shadow twists in my hands 
oh farther than everything oh farther than everything 
it is the hour of departure oh abandoned one
it was many and many a year ago 
   in a kingdom by the sea 
that a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   by the name of annabel lee 
and this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   than to love and be loved by me 
i was a child and she was a child 
   in this kingdom by the sea 
but we loved with a love that was more than love 
   i and my annabel lee 
with a love that the wingd seraphs of heaven 
   coveted her and me 
and this was the reason that long ago 
   in this kingdom by the sea 
a wind blew out of a cloud chilling 
   my beautiful annabel lee 
so that her highborn kinsmen came 
   and bore her away from me 
to shut her up in a sepulchre 
   in this kingdom by the sea 
the angels not half so happy in heaven 
   went envying her and me 
yesthat was the reason as all men know 
   in this kingdom by the sea 
that the wind came out of the cloud by night 
   chilling and killing my annabel lee 
but our love it was stronger by far than the love 
   of those who were older than we 
   of many far wiser than we 
and neither the angels in heaven above 
   nor the demons down under the sea 
can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
   of the beautiful annabel lee 
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams 
   of the beautiful annabel lee 
and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes 
   of the beautiful annabel lee 
and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side 
   of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride 
   in her sepulchre there by the sea 
   in her tomb by the sounding sea
