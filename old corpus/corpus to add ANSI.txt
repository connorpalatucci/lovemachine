 
LET us go then, you and I,	
When the evening is spread out against the sky	
Like a patient etherized upon a table;	
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,	
The muttering retreats	        5
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels	
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:	
Streets that follow like a tedious argument	
Of insidious intent	
To lead you to an overwhelming question….	        10
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”	
Let us go and make our visit.	
 
In the room the women come and go	
Talking of Michelangelo.	
 GARDEN of bliss, where fairest flowers are culled;	
    Rich mine of treasures, wanting no bright gem;	
Serpentless Eden of a blesséd pair;	
    Best jewel in a life’s bright diadem.	
 
Hence with the thought of shame to him who deems	        5
THERE was a damned successful Poet;	
  There was a Woman like the Sun.	
And they were dead. They did not know it.	
  They did not know their time was done.	
  They did not know his hymns	        5
  Were silence; and her limbs,	
  That had served Love so well,	
  Dust, and a filthy smell.	
  That silence again
             a wall
of feathers, and near
 
enough
            to block the
circuit of our time—
 
Adobe wall,
           roads of dust—
thirty two years
 
until the bones
            discoursed—
That's how long
 
I've dug into
            myself—
And the baby?
 
She is a promise—
            ungraspable,
mist—
 
Fuss or no fuss,
           yearn, yearn,
yearn. Heart
 
pounds, ears

3 AM walks on Fridays across the Marais—from that insomniac
bar on Rue de Lappe, via a Place des Vosges gurgling secrets
in her sleep, zagging down to Rue du Roi de Sicile before
zigging back to the tip of Rue des Francs-Bourgeois
((sound asleep)), with pit stops to salute gothic
gargoyles, brush Art Deco façades, and peer
at miniature parks penned in for the night—
then up Boulevard de Sébastopol, up north,
all the way north to your shared digs
in Château Rouge, holding a wasted,
bedraggled moon aloft, turn by
slow turn—first you, then I—
till he would faint & fall
from an unsafe,
matinal
sky.    

 Fortnightly
sessions—when down
to the last clean fitted sheet—
at the prematurely aged laundrette
rasping out wrong or no change on the top
floor (was it? Or does memory begin to fray?) of
Résidence André Allix, high above the funicular station
at Saint-Juste, Vieux Lyon; some years later, the same ritual
with the swankier, snootier machines in Château-Landon, Paris
claiming more coins; the tortuous rides you would take to reach—
each time—before I’d begin to fold the cobalt nakshi kantha
quilt (you had brought back from a fair trade crafts village
near the northern suburbs of Dhaka) that you knew
I should trip over—each time—if left alone (that
quilt still alive, still untorn: strangers tend
to help, most, keen to touch, to stroke
the wealth of colors, to ask, Where
is it/are you from? One came
home the other day). 
Vernal
morning-walk
battles simmering
from the night before,
wildfiring, pyring by the axis
of Parc Josaphat in Schaerbeek;
our voices scorching the sleep-filled
wings of the neighboring swans, and
words—both barbed and burning—whirl-
pooling the ponds beneath their feet, then all
of it—the earth, the air, the green, that high blaze
of words and decibels, yes, everything—unspooling
in a snarl of arms and thighs, hips and groins, extra-large
elbows, tongues and—it once even felt—uncaged ribs with
double, smelted hearts, purple-hot beneath and hammering their
own daft, arrhythmic anthem, overheard only by an inquiring fox
 


 If you must hear      the story
of my turbulent gaze      after waking,

the march of my hours      to hermit
into a higher body,      it is that

whatever you put            into the Universe
eventually       returns.

In our oneness      of gift,
                     we are eyes together,

nerves together,         affected together.
If I’ve never      told you

how madly we share      in the stars,

how it was all      founded      for you,
then let the longing      for Arcturus

                     be the gilding      of our sleep.

I know      when your time      was in its
making,      I was left      to sing alone,

unfed      to trample through      a hundred
layers      of night      without a heart

                                   to hold my guard.
These are all ancient names of what you will once call home.


The shape of the fire altar is independent of time.
hen death fell asleep between my legs
One arm slung over my knee
I pulled her up to my leaking breasts
And heard her grind her teeth

—

Does not inhabit herself
Stun guns of solar hair and eye flash hide her age
Born in a mirror in water precariously unheld
Will never die

—

Sometimes runeface spreads
Wind wrinkling a lake
Dolphins flipping at eyes and mouth

Sometimes a crucifix
Nose the bent of spine
Splayed veins from eyebolts

—

A bit inconvenient
To die just to drop

This sticky lover
That loveless parent

If only one could just get plastic surgery
Change lives behind the shrubbery

—

Not fair

I get older so
Do you I
Never catch

Up you train me
For your death

To my patterns you do
Patterns I want something

To shock you
My namesake tree

To drop all its leaves
In the center of spring

Remind me what
I gain by being here

Love me in a hurry

St. Andrews. Forbach. Gothenburg. Sète. Douai. Roubaix. The towns we knew as shapes at night, or a stranger in the next berth half-hidden beneath a duvet. A whirling midnight of boat-hopping in Nantes. Half of Lyon from 2001: all the mornings julienned into sunshine and periwinkle skies at Croix-Rousse; Sunday ends at La Cigale (or was it La Fourmi, or both?), redolent of the ashes and smoke and crimson drapes of Wong Kar-wai; the salad bowl tossing an ever-delayed sunrise over your cracked skylight; those 73 lines (563 words) you managed to fit alongside eternity on an un-postmarked card. Some constellations—Aquarius, Aries, Hydra, Pegasus. The blue-and-canary-yellow polka-dotted python who still gobbles me up on the 99th square. A weekend in Rouen where I drank the sun with a red plastic straw. Dimples on your stubbled left cheek that surface from a dream at 5 am alone, my wonder at their constancy. Your hands wrapped around my fugitive breath even through those dreams. The sight of a baby in the metro who looked like she could be ours (and my relief she was not). The July afternoon the sun left the map of Spain on a thigh. The year I turned cartographer at beachside siestas, mapping the stir of sand across your back, the blue rivulets under your skin navigating their way toward a heartbeat. The giant, prismatic, poster of Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding covering fissures on a kitchen wall; two wickerwork laundry baskets from Dinjan; wooden ladles, now splintered; that livid indigo hand-braided quilt: the first among joint possessions. Twelve-hour road trips across France under unwashed stars to help resettle schoolmates. Piles of moldy Satyajit Ray VHS tapes. A map of free Bangladesh. The Maori mask gifted by a fellow passenger on the train from Georgetown. Noughts-and-crosses played on the rafters of a hotel ceiling. Every yesterday but the second, quieter than the first yet more fragrant. Keep them, and stay: yes, they are yours from today.  




I ran across the street, I didn’t know any better.
Ran out in the street, I didn’t know no better.
I just knew a woman was there, though I’d never met her.

She sat me in her parlor, distracted me with trinkets,
milky glass birds and fish, distracting trinkets.
She said my mother would be fine, but did she think it?

The world was a blur of crystal wings and fins.
My tears were casked in crystal, wings and fins.
She was the first of many lady-friends.

The tree shadows shortened, she brought me a drink of water.
Morning matured, she brought me a glass of water.
I drank it so fast, she went and brought another.

I kept looking out the window, she didn’t ask me what for.
I watched out that window, she didn’t ask what for.
The seconds broke off and lay there on the floor.

I imagined my mother’s route, as far as I could.
Her long morning walk, followed as far as I could.
Nothing I could do would do any good.

Suffer the little children, and forbid them not.
Christ said suffer the little children, and forbid them not.
Said love thy neighbor, sometimes she’s all you got.
Everything we do and say in patriarchy can be traced
back to “Strangers in the Night.” Your faded jeans, my
faint daytime smile. (Dazzling’s so expensive.) Bad
Mailer novels; lose-money-quick schemes. A fortune in
friendship, nevertheless. Beef farmers favor self-flesh
awareness. (Or brittle in toffee queen regimes.) Thoughts
as feats of strength. The figure in the woodpile as a
white snake, two needle bites. The end of the week, of
us, strangers now or not? I’m dressed in white, I am the
right blonde in the wrong seaplane, I haven’t learnt the

language yet. The meta-leopards will have taken over
the aquarium. They’ll stroll this way like kangaroos to
green glass. Papa, I’ve upset you. There’ll be a line of
songs like crystals lining up to kiss the bell that says Big
Town. We are on the roof now, playing to Central Park
everyone hot in their coats. Paid for not stolen. They
admit to being too late for miracles, for charity. The
poem’s parents are in the front row. The poem’s friend
interprets. Can we repeat it without going back to the
start, the lover’s demand like ants beneath the plaint?

In Eden, in Athens, estrangement flowers. We turn and
return. Is it love itself, beckoning from the lurid grass-
lands? There’s a cuteness to plaster’s novelty hiding of
the body. People are cited in the mouth, stand on the
ground. They fly like Lucy. You can deny it all for fun
and parties, as if the mind was the feeling that input
gives. It’s a power no one likes to admit, as it so often
leads to failure in later life, like living in a swimming
pool, or losing your tongue in the mail. What of
romances with characters from books? Alice says hello
Dear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound:
beneath the house, the kegs roll in;
the party flips its switches down.

When drunk comes, it comes as sound,
a chord, a liftoff. I ride the rim,
dear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound.

He could be anyone, and he abounds.
I slip inside a dance with him.
The party flips its switches down.

Let’s go, he says, upstairs now.
My cup spills. My shirt is skin.

ut all I want to do is marry them on a beach

that refuses to take itself too seriously.

So much of our lives has been serious.

Over time, I’ve learned that love is most astonishing

when it persists after learning where we come from.

When I bring my partner to my childhood home

it is all bullets and needles and trash bags held

at arm’s length. It is my estranged father’s damp

bed of cardboard and cigar boxes filled

with gauze and tarnished spoons. It is hard

to clean a home, but it is harder to clean

the memory of it. When I was young, my

father would light lavender candles and shoot

up. Now, my partner and I light a fire that will

burn all traces of the family that lived here.

Black plastic smoke curdles up, and loose bullets

discharge in the flames. My partner holds

my hand as gunfire rings through

the birch trees. Though this is almost

From up here in the leaves’ no-kidding goldishness
you’d guess everyone was already in lovely w/ each
others’ cheekbones. Infinity scarves
& vanilla coffee, mint tea, warm whatever.
Cozy becoming the coming-at-the-seams, a couplet
of verbs mid-bodily inexperience.
That man doing cartwheels is not wearing a shirt
& in any other life I’d want to be the double dare
fanfaring a future so totally astonished
by his nipples. This is what I mean

when I say things like catastrophe.
Okay, fine. Just one more winter.
Nothing can compare anymore to us anymore.
You big good oak limb. I’m in such cute like w/ you today.

In one diary of my have-beens, my mother
named me Elizabeth after one of her
mothers. You god particle. You matrilineage.
I’ve never lived anywhere more
or less this haunted. She named my sister
Elizabeth. You boy
genius. You midsummer pinky promise ring.

There’s this person I know I’m not in love w/ but wears
a dress patterned like a postcard from the state my grandma
died in. Imagine waking up
a whole frame away from your bedsheets. Imagine
waking up & being anything as yellow
as a dress. You treeline. You root song. What’s an amount
of time equal
to you? You kindling ring finger. You unchewable bark
but the headache’s gone. Pardon me, dandelions,
have you seen my ghost, six foot nothing,

has an interstate for a mother but also a mother? Adjust
your spurs, honeybunch. This time I’m writing all of us
in pink ink. Let’s huckle-buckle off into the leafiest
of all possible genderings. You know how the rain
starts right after you get home & the country song
your friend slow-danced w/ her big love to, the one
your mom would play real quiet on her moonbeam
highway streak back to Pensacola, is somehow

already at the chorus & you forget there are words like joy?
Or when someone whispers Imagine you never met them
back at the bum, grinning stars? You remember.
It’s like that.
Or, is that. The difference between salt & salt. A someday
of matching sweaters.
Told you it’s cute. O sweaters. O little knit
bundles of vegetable-spit. It’s always sunsetting.

You golden hour. You soap-soft seasonal.
Once my mom found me
sitting in a circle of candles, touching each rosebud
& sat w/ me until we were wax musuems
of our secrets. Look—
the sky’s a toenail & the moon’s a chesthair. All the shirtless
boys have tired themself out, spread-eagled
& slapping the sun off their shoulder blades. My body is a line
heading for my body. You crushed-grass
sex smell. You dirt-inverted comma. Someone w/ bleached
hair is biking home to restud their denim.
I rediscovered kissing foreheads & it is so yes again.

Hurry up & sunspot, daylilies!
The cops aren’t going to awe themselves
to death & we have
a dictionary to laugh across.
by going you have to be and
seek it
out
 
said the starlet in the shared volitional language of space and time
explanation thrashes round the thing but doesn’t touch it
the thing we know then as /style of thrashing/ or
ripples in the pond sufficient
in itself, she licks her tongue, it could be desired as a figure—
 
faithless as a class of examples
i found new objects swimming blankly in a common
sense, by going alone to listen
                                                to them
                         in the night
            light of their pool—
 Oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower 
Around thee clouds of woe and ill, 
Let me yet feel that I have power, 
Mid Fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. 

Tho' sadness be upon thy brow, 
Yet let it turn, dear love, to me, 
I cannot bear that thou should'st know 
Sorrow I do not share with thee. 

True love's wreath is of mountain flowers, 
They stand the storm and brave the blast, 
And blossom on, so love like ours 
Is sweetest when all else is past. 

Too well I know what storms have frowned, 
And now frown on life's troubled tide; 
Still darker let them gather round, 
They have no power on hearts so tried. 

Then say not that you may not bear, 
To shadow spirit light as mine; 
I shall not shrink, or fear to share 
The darkest fate if it be thine!
 

Oh! say not love was never made 
For heart so light as mine; 
Must love then seek the cypress shade, 
Rear but a gloomy shrine. 

Oh! say not, that for me more meet 
The revelry of youth; 
Or that my wild heart cannot beat 
With deep devoted truth. 

Tho' mirth may many changes ring, 
'Tis but an outward show, 
Even upon the fond dove's wing 
Will varying colours glow. 

Light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
And sparkle o'er my brow, 
'Tis but the glisten of the stream 
That hides the gold below. 

'Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, 
That lights the smile for me, 
Those smiles would instant lose their power, 
Did they not glance on thee!
 

Oh! come to my slumber 
Sweet dreams of my love, 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above. 

The roses are linked 
In a chain pure and white; 
And the rose-leaves are wet 
With the dew drops of night. 

The moon was on high 
As I gather'd each flower; 
The dew that then falls 
Has a magical power. 

The Spirit of slumber 
Those roses has blest; 
And sweet are the visions 
They'll bring to my rest. 

Be their spell on my soul, 
So they let me but see 
His dark eyes flash in love 
And his smile glance on me. 

Let sleep bring the image 
Of him far away; 
'Tis worth all the tears 
I shed for him by day. 

I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above; 
Then come to my slumber, 
Sweet dreams of my love!
 

How vain to cast my love away 
On bosom false as thine; 
The floweret's bloom, that springs in May, 
Would be a safer shrine 

To build my fondest hopes upon, 
Tho' fragile it may be. 
That flower's smile is not sooner gone 
Than love that trusts to thee. 

Love asks a calm, a gentle home, 
Or else its life is o'er; 
If once you let its pinions roam, 
Oh! then 'tis love no more. 

The aspin's changefuI shade can be 
No shelter for the dove; 
And hearts as varying as that tree, 
Are sure no place for love. 

Hope linger'd long and anxiously, 
O'er failing faith, but now 
I give thee back each heartless sigh, 
Give back each broken vow. 

I'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, 
The calm of yon wild sea, 
The sunshine of the April skies, 
But never more to thee! 
 

Oh! would that love had power to raise 
A little isle for us alone, 
With fairy flowers, and sunny rays, 
The blue sea wave its guardian zone. 

No other step should ever press 
This hidden Eden of the heart, 
And we would share its loveliness, 
From every other thing apart. 

The rose and violet should weep, 
Whene'er our leafy couch was laid, 
The lark should wake our morning sleep, 
The bulbul sing our serenade. 
f it became impossible to touch and be touched, to see
and be seen, to love and trade ecstasy for risk where risk
is ecstasy, to be hidden in plain view, to be perfectly lost
which means lost to the world, lying side-by-side arms linked
in a bond so intricate it could never unfold or break—
If it became crucial to live out of sight, to be housebound,
to walk a beaten path in the garden, to sit at the window
blurred by rainfall, to sit barred and blocked, books
set aside that would never be read, rolling news of flash flood
and fire, angels treading the updraft, a chaos of voices—
If dreams should give the rest of it: the path in the garden
going underground, flood and fire as God’s only gift
the house holding its secrets, that pattern of locked rooms,
what lies outside (voices: angels) crowding the perimeter—


You could make an installation of it
(and why not?) on a bare floor
in a bare hall under neon strip:
what seems thrown down what seems
heap after heap of discards but is not:
hair and shoes and spectacles
and clothes (teeth also saved)
repetition such that it blurs
images folding into one another
abstract, just shape being evident
except this shoe except
this lens catching the light which is
error or artifact, something like
iron litter carefully thrown down
by Joseph Beuys but more the bright
grotesque of Bacon’s Fragment,
of Dubuffet’s L’Arbre de fluides,
what’s torn what’s wrenched apart?...
Heap after heap, grainy footage
of a cattle train snowscape
smokestacks, scratch orchestra, what
more do you need?...?dogs?...?what more
do you need of this: the train
all but silent in snow, footage
of carcasses thrown down naked,
you could make a montage of it:
quick hands, a low sun deepening
to yellow by trees and towers,
the way shadows are cast, the light
you need, the shapes you need
a sureness of touch to bring it all
together, perhaps a light box
fragments and fractures backlit
and all of a piece not least
the new dead: they lie
in a scatter, your focal point
they make sudden broken
angels in the snow.
Fool steps up. His art is palimpsest.
He’ll tag your work: spray-paint
a ditzy orange bug-eyed frog
at the door of the charnel house
color the snowscape blue, redact
the chimneys, configure the train
with silver-and-black chevrons:
a snake drawn up to the iron gate,
his artwork: Evil is as evil does.
The frog spits bile. The snake
is hollow-eyed. He adds
speech bubbles to the cold still air:
“Hosanna Hosanna Ho—sa—nna”:


 when the air shaped like the inverse of Megan
accepts Megan as she moves.

    If Megan is a system of exchange
that floats her labor and her point

  of view in vapor/liquid soup
passàging through her valves

and if her later corpse, collapsing,
 updates its inversion of the air

 even more than did the air displace
when she grew from brown-eyed baby

into strong laboring woman in blue jeans
  and heathered wool,

and if the air and earth draw from Megan’s corpse
  all the energy and minerals

 she pulled from her surrounds
to build her nails and bones and teeth—

 if the exchange doesn’t stop
but only ceases to support her consciousness,

 and if her consciousness was corpse anyway until
it found relation,

 then what demises
is the potential for the human social,

and another sociality
 will unbutton my whole shoe

and tongue hang limp,
  what sex is for but stops me

 at the barrier, a pixelated
glamour reef though very

   close and simple, smell a
  flurry, parapluie paraphrase,

 energy funneled through a shape.
You filtered chemical

 information in such a pointy
fulgent scrambled way, in the city
I thought I had lost myself,
but I see it’s you that’s gone missing.

O always elsewhere.

What yacht or spaceship have you hijacked?

In what seedy hideaway do you scoff
at the sameness of all cities, all ideas?

Once you made me loquacious
because what’s the point in saying anything
if there isn’t the possibility of being misunderstood.

Now I am nearly speechless with boredom.
I will wait Madame Butterfly-style for your return.

Light falls from her voice
and I try to catch it as the last
light of the day fades?...
But there is no form to touch,
no pain to trace.

Are dreams
taking their seats
on the night train?

3

She recites a list of wishes
to keep him from dying.

4

The truth lands like a kiss—
sometimes like a mosquito,
sometimes like a lantern.

5

Your coffee-colored skin
awakens me to the world.

6

We have only one minute
and I love you.

7

All children are poets
until they quit the habit
of reaching for butterflies
that are not there.

8

The moment you thought you lost me,
you saw me clearly
with all of my flowers,
even the dried ones.

9

If you pronounce all letters
and vowels at once,
you would hear their names
falling drop by drop
with the rain.

10

We carved
our ancestral trees into boats.
The boats sailed into harbors
that looked safe from afar.

11

Trees talk to each other
like old friends
and don’t like to be interrupted.
They follow anyone who
cuts one of them,
turning that person
into a lonely cut branch.
Is this why in Arabic
we say “cut of a tree”
when we mean
“having no one”?

12

The way roots hide
under trees—
there are secrets,
faces, and wind
behind the colors
in Rothko’s untitled canvases.

13

Will the sea forget its waves,
as caves forgot us?

14

Back when there was no language
they walked until sunset
carrying red leaves
like words to remember.

15

It’s true that pain
is like air, available
everywhere,
but we each feel
our pain hurts the most.

16

So many of them died
under stars
that don’t know their names.

17

If she just survived with me.

18

A flame dims in the fireplace,
a day slips quietly away from the calendar,
and Fairuz sings, “They say love kills time,
and they also say time kills love.”

19

The street vendor offers tourists
necklaces with divided hearts,
seashells to murmur the sea’s secrets in your ear,
squishy balls to make you feel better,
maps of homelands you fold
in your pocket as you go on your way.

Of many reasons I love you here is one

the way you write me from the gate at the airport
so I can tell you everything will be alright

so you can tell me there is a bird
trapped in the terminal      all the people
ignoring it       because they do not know
what to do with it       except to leave it alone
until it scares itself to death

it makes you terribly terribly sad

You wish you could take the bird outside
and set it free or       (failing that)
call a bird-understander
to come help the bird
The shine on her buckle took precedence in sun
Her shine, I should say, could take me anywhere
It feels right to be up this close in tight wind
It feels right to notice all the shiny things about you
About you there is nothing I wouldn’t want to know
With you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler
About you many good things come into relation
I think of proofs and grammar, vowel sounds, like
A is for knee socks, E for panties
I is for buttondown, O the blouse you wear
U is for hair clip, and Y your tight skirt
The music picks up again, I am the man I hope to be
The bright air hangs freely near your newly cut hair
It is so easy now to see gravity at work in your face
Easy to understand time, that dark process
To accept it as a beautiful process, your face

Guy calls the doctor, says the wife’s   
contractions are five minutes apart.   
Doctor says, Is this her first child?
guy says, No, it’s her husband.

I promise to try to remember who   
I am. Wife gets up on one elbow,

says, I wanted to get married.   
It seemed a fulfillment of some

several things, a thing to be done.   
Even the diamond ring was some

thing like a quest, a thing they   
set you out to get and how insane

the quest is; how you have to turn   
it every way before you can even

think to seek it; this metaphysical   
refraining is in fact the quest. Who’d
Waking
on the train, I thought   
we were attacked
It has been so wet stones glaze in moss;
everything blooms coldly.
Cherry plums suck a week’s soak,
overnight they explode into the scenery of before
your touch. The curtains open on the end of our past.
Pink trumpets on the vines bare to the hummingbirds.
Butterflies unclasp from the purse of their couplings, they
light and open on the doubled hands of eucalyptus fronds.
They sip from the pistils for seven generations that bear
them through another tongue as the first year of our
punishing mathematic begins clicking the calendar
forward. They land like seasoned rocks on the
decks of the cliffs. They take another turn
on the spiral of life where the blossoms
blush & pale in a day of dirty dawn
where the ghost of you webs
your limbs through branches
of cherry plum. Rare bird,
extinct color, you stay in
my dreams in x-ray. In
rerun, the bone of you
stripping sweethearts
folds and layers the
shedding petals of
my grief into a
decayed holo-

but not much. A launch draws   
two lines of wake behind it   
on the bay like a delta
with a melted base. Sandy   
billows, or so they look,
of feathery ripe heads of grass,   
an acid-yellow kind of
goldenrod glowing or glowering   
in shade. Rocks with rags   
of shadow, washed dust clouts   
that will never bleach.
It is not like this at all.   
The rapid running of the   
lapping water a hollow knock
of someone shipping oars:   
it’s eleven years since   
Frank sat at this desk and   
saw and heard it all   
the incessant water the   
immutable crickets only   
not the same: new needles   
on the spruce, new seaweed   
on the low-tide rocks   
other grass and other water   
even the great gold lichen   
on a granite boulder   
even the boulder quite   
literally is not the same

      II
A day subtle and suppressed   
in mounds of juniper enfolding   
scratchy pockets of shadow
while bigness—rocks, trees, a stump—
stands shadowless in an overcast   
of ripe grass. There is nothing   
but shade, like the boggy depths   
of a stand of spruce, its resonance   
just the thin scream
of mosquitoes ascending.
Boats are light lumps on the bay   
stretching past erased islands   
to ocean and the terrible tumble   
and London (“rain persisting”)   
and Paris (“changing to rain”).   
Delicate day, setting the bright
of a young spruce against the cold
of an old one hung with unripe cones   
each exuding at its tip
gum, pungent, clear as a tear,   
a day tarnished and fractured   
as the quartz in the rocks
of a dulled and distant point,   
a day like a gull passing
with a slow flapping of wings   
in a kind of lope, without
breeze enough to shake loose   
the last of the fireweed flowers,
a faintly clammy day, like wet silk   
stained by one dead branch   
the harsh russet of dried blood.

I expect you. I thought one night it was you
at the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs,

you in a shiver of light, but each time
leaves in wind revealed themselves,

the retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak.
We expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove.

In May we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires
over which young men and women leapt.

June efforts quietly.
I’ve planted vegetables along each garden wall

so even if spring continues to disappoint
we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain.

I have new gloves and a new hoe.
I practice eulogies. He was a hawk

with white feathered legs. She had the quiet ribs
of a salamander crossing the old pony post road.

Yours is the name the leaves chatter
at the edge of the unrabbited woods.
            by light:   
chrome-winged birds   
For the first time, I listen to a lost
and secret recording of us
making love near-on ten years ago.

I recognize your voice, your sounds,
though if I knew no better,
I could be any man in any room.

After, the rising sounds of rising
and of dressing and once
as you step up close to the deck,

perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing
the chorus of Sunday Morning.
I call on you to hurry and we leave.

It does not end then; the tape rolls on.
A few late cars which sigh by
might have passed us walking away

triumphant, unaware we’ve left behind
this mop and mow mechanism
of silence to which we may never return.

The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone! 
Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast, 
Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone, 
Bright eyes, accomplish’d shape, and lang’rous waist! 
Faded the flower and all its budded charms, 
Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes, 
Faded the shape of beauty from my arms, 
Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise – 
Vanish’d unseasonably at shut of eve, 
When the dusk holiday – or holinight 
Of fragrant-curtain’d love begins to weave 
The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight, 
But, as I’ve read love’s missal through to-day, 
He’ll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.

            That first day   
the buoys were all   
that made the harbor

            bearable:
pennies sewn into a hemline.   
Later I learned to live in it,

            to walk
through the alien city—
a beekeeper’s habit—

            with fierce light   
clinging to my head and hands.   
Treated as gently as every

            other guest—
each house’s barbed antennae   
trawling for any kind

            of weather—
still I sobbed in a glass box   
on an unswept street

            with the last
few lire ticking like fleas

You did not come, 
And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,— 
Yet less for loss of your dear presence there 
Than that I thus found lacking in your make 
That high compassion which can overbear 
Reluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sake 
Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum, 
You did not come. 

You love not me, 
And love alone can lend you loyalty; 
–I know and knew it. But, unto the store 
Of human deeds divine in all but name, 
Was it not worth a little hour or more 
To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came 
To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be 
You love not me? 

my pleasures fully expected,   
when the expectation of them
Somewhere or other there must surely be 
The face not seen, the voice not heard, 
The heart that not yet—never yet—ah me! 
Made answer to my word. 

Somewhere or other, may be near or far; 
Past land and sea, clean out of sight; 
Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star 
That tracks her night by night. 

Somewhere or other, may be far or near; 
With just a wall, a hedge, between; 
With just the last leaves of the dying year 
Fallen on a turf grown green. 

grows patterned in its steady   
surprise. I’ve got my sweet
Take, oh, take those lips away 
That so sweetly were forsworn 
And those eyes, like break of day, 
Lights that do mislead the morn; 
But my kisses bring again, 
Seals of love, though sealed in vain. 

Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow, 
Which thy frozen bosom bears, 
On whose tops the pinks that grow 
Are of those that April wears; 
But first set my poor heart free, 
Bound in those icy chains by thee.
and tumble pat. Here on earth,   
I like to count upon a thing
Through your lens the sequoia swallowed me   
like a dryad. The camera flashed & forgot.
I, on the other hand, must practice my absent-
mindedness, memory being awkward as a touch   
that goes unloved. Lately your eyes have shut
down to a shade more durable than skin’s. I know you   
love distance, how it smooths. You choose an aerial view,   
the city angled to abstraction, while I go for the close   
exposures: poorly-mounted countenances along Broadway,   
the pigweed cracking each hardscrabble backlot.   
It’s a matter of perspective: yours is to love me   
from a block away & mine is to praise the grain-
iness that weaves expressively: your face.

Things happen when you drink too much mescal.
One night, with not enough food in my belly,
he kept on buying.   I’m a girl who’ll fall
damn near in love with gratitude and, well, he
was hot and generous and so the least
that I could do was let him kiss me, hard
and soft and any way you want it, beast
and beauty, lime and salt—sweet Bacchus’ pards—
and when his friend showed up I felt so warm
and generous I let him kiss me too.
His buddy asked me if it was the worm
inside that makes me do the things I do.
I wasn’t sure which worm he meant, the one
I ate?   The one that eats at me alone?


like that. Thus explained   
the woman in contractions

to her lover holding on
the telephone for the doctor

to recover from this strange   
conversational turn. You say

you’re whom? It is a pleasure   
to meet you. She rolls her

eyes, but he’d once asked her   
Am I your first lover? and she’d   
said, Could be. Your face looks   
familiar. It’s the same type of

generative error. The grammar
of the spoken word will flip, let alone

the written, until something new is   
in us, and in our conversation.



I loved you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
And loved me for what might or might not be –
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’
With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.
You have changed me already. I am a fireball
That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball
That is throwing sparks upon your face
Oh look at them shake
Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
O too this is so dramatic this shaking
Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
So you ran and hid
Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think
That tree although soon she will wither
Into ten black snakes upon your throat
And when she does I will be wandering as I always am
A graceful lady that is part museum
Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
I will hold your voice in a little box
And when you come upon me I won’t look back at you
You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back
Into the heart from where it came from
And I will not cry also
Although you will expect me to
I was wiser too than you had expected
For I knew all along you were mine
You are like me, you will die too, but not today:   
you, incommensurate, therefore the hours shine:   
if I say to you “To you I say,” you have not been   
set to music, or broadcast live on the ghost   
radio, may never be an oil painting or
Old Master’s charcoal sketch: you are
a concordance of person, number, voice,
and place, strawberries spread through your name   
as if it were budding shrubs, how you remind me   
of some spring, the waters as cool and clear
(late rain clings to your leaves, shaken by light wind),   
which is where you occur in grassy moonlight:   
and you are a lily, an aster, white trillium
or viburnum, by all rights mine, white star   
in the meadow sky, the snow still arriving
from its earthwards journeys, here where there is   
no snow (I dreamed the snow was you,
when there was snow), you are my right,
have come to be my night (your body takes on   
the dimensions of sleep, the shape of sleep   
becomes you): and you fall from the sky
with several flowers, words spill from your mouth
in waves, your lips taste like the sea, salt-sweet (trees   
and seas have flown away, I call it
loving you): home is nowhere, therefore you,   
a kind of dwell and welcome, song after all,   
and free of any eden we can name

All you can do is notice the bird
and feel for the bird       and write
to tell me how language feels
impossibly useless
  Busy old fool, unruly sun,
               Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
               Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
               Late school boys and sour prentices,
         Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
         Call country ants to harvest offices,
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.
Drink to me only with thine eyes, 
         And I will pledge with mine; 
Or leave a kiss but in the cup, 
         And I’ll not look for wine. 
The thirst that from the soul doth rise 
         Doth ask a drink divine; 
But might I of Jove’s nectar sup, 
         I would not change for thine. 
Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call—
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robb’ry, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love’s wrong than hate’s known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath, 
         Not so much honouring thee 
As giving it a hope, that there 
         It could not withered be. 
But thou thereon didst only breathe, 
         And sent’st it back to me; 
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear, 
         Not of itself, but thee.
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o’er-sways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O, how shall summer’s honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
   O, none, unless this miracle have might,
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.


               Thy beams, so reverend and strong
               Why shouldst thou think?
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,
But that I would not lose her sight so long;
               If her eyes have not blinded thine,
               Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine
         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.

               She's all states, and all princes, I,
               Nothing else is.
Princes do but play us; compared to this,
All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
               Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
               In that the world's contracted thus.
         Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
         To warm the world, that's done in warming us.
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.

but you are wrong
If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.
You are a bird-understander
better than I could ever be
who make so many noises
and call them song

These are your own words
your way of noticing
and saying plainly
of not turning away
from hurt

you have offered them
to me       I am only
giving them back

if only I could show you
how very useless
they are not
I am haunted by the melody
of a forgotten song
sung while two hands
tied my shoelaces into a ribbon
and waved me goodbye to school.

21

If I could photocopy
the moment we met
I would find it full
of all the days and nights.

22

It won’t forget the faraway child,
that city whose door stayed open
for passersby, tourists, and invaders.

23

The moon is going to the other
side of the world
to call my loved ones.

24

The seasons change
colors and you come and go.
What color is your departure?

    and outside the city in the vernal zones
   and aqua zones the city shaped, flow-charted, realist

 trucked. The city caved under
     when the zones rose and lapped around the pilings,

 manged foundations green,
      rotted the teeth out of the mouth of the city,

 harbor high-rises
dark and blown. The city is extremely fragile tender

 human mesh and will be mush
    and mushrooms grow in, there is room in, ruins

roam the rearticulated harm.

On my face, D. folliculorum are relaxing
 like Tenniel caterpillars leaning on mushroom stalks
  against the bases of my hair follicles
 which provide shelter and shade.
These critters are peculiar to
   the ecology of the human face
     which I take around the city
     open, close   it is my means
    of feeding   I rely on
  changing its shape
in response to others’ faces and postures
  to reduce my risk and increase my safety
   and my likelihood of being
    included in the group’s collective
      life. I smile a lot and hope it
     don’t look fake.


Children in a pool of light, a pool of dust; the way
images deceive, the way time shunts and stalls, a test
of what gathers and corrupts, what will not stay
as words unspeak, as children are lost to light and dust.
And we would watch the starry hours, 
And call the moon to hear our vows, 
And we would cull the sweetest flowers, 
And twine fresh chaplets for our brows. 
 Yes of forsythia against the limitless ivy, a nude posed in a garden
against the silver maple pinwheeling its children into a gown around her
Stricken, seen, satellite at the edge of a party,
being fifteen, with the black bulbs someone’s planted
in the mother’s lamps to give glow-in-the-dark
ambiance to hideous kisses, and the ruffles
are all wrong on the saved-for shirt, and the curtains,
suave in the murk, seem to laugh. The liquidy
fin of feeling is destination-less, twisting
like paper wrapped ’round a pinkie
in blind date anticipation. Toy for
the psyche, phrase to swim through the mind
like an offense, at 3 AM.
Half-helix, as if waiting for, Oh God, don’t
say it, a soul mate. What sheathes the stealth
bomber has something of its skin. Pastiche of pluck
and terror, nerve faltering halfway. Opposite
of starlight, stagnant brook that drowned Ophelia, JPEG
from a former colleague, on holiday, landed in spam,
looking older and captioned, Well, here I am.

chime of the cliff-hanging falcon’s screeching talons against a rabbit,
wheezing soldier in a field, gunpowder tainting the cake in his pocket

jet fuel over the Pacific, waking to a hula in a zephyr,
the bride deplaning onto an island chain, bowing to leis of plumeria

the mallow of nurses’ shoes, their news, the black sedan
of a telephone spreading it like a virus and, after, the scent of a cedar closet

white gloves of a mare, in heat, pawing clover, the sail of a Spitfire
cresting a hill in San Francisco, angelic against sunset

rosin on the cello’s catgut, a honeycombed queen calling home
her lovers, a Basquiat above the head of an ascetic, chaos over order

magenta in the thorns, shy to the shears, making the blue jays bluer,
a someone on the bed’s chenille edge, composing an oratorio of medicines

I thought thus of the flowers, the moon, 
This fairy isle for you and me; 
And then I thought how very soon 
How very tired we should be.
 

                  Matrimonial Creed.

HE must be rich whom I could love, 
His fortune clear must be, 
Whether in land or in the funds, 
'Tis all the same to me. 

He must be old whom I could love, 
Then he'll not plague me long; 
In sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,
To see him borne along 

To where the croaking ravens lurk, 
And where the earth worms dwell: 
A widow's hood will suit my face,
And black becomes me well. 

And he must make a settlement, 
I'll have no man without; 
And when he writes his testament, 
He must not leave me out. 

Oh! such a man as this would suit 
Each wish I here express; 
If he should say, — Will you have me? 
I'll very soon say — Yes! ?
 
                       Holed up behind the whitewashed wooden slats
slung like ribs above the greed-begotten candy plaster-
papered noworlaters, holed up and far
from witches in the woods’ evergreen fringe,
horse chestnut brews, parents’ crow commotion or
robin squabble haranguing the fat
wide open always out there, I read for hours
on the red shag rug hearing market cry
and grave slope, catching the men through ages
of flint and full haggle in my 2 by 6 chamber,
heart bent on Blue Beard, the dead wives’
skeletons cantilevered to a door hook. Later,
hunkering down with amputee hangers,
catalogs, the bottle stash and jug wines,
Jim Beams too hiding with air, no air,
plus a stolen Joy of Sex circa 1974,
its pell mell positions and crouching
women, with the POV going scrap and rattle,
some theater of being a little less bright.
Thought I saw one night the million paired eyes
swinging upward, the hand me down generations
spelunking in holes, fine lineaments braved
by way of cream curd and lust and dictatorial DNA,
felt through overhead squib and carpet warp,
some full squat before the slate rock hearths,
more buried in strata of granites, igneous,
limestone, ash, the mind’s eye leveled
to one rectangle of light around the animal
who wants to know that it knows and say so,
lumbering down the long path, vanishing.

                        said about the birds
                        as distance is required for attraction
                        & force keeps its distinctions
                        in a tall hull
                        called law—
                        clever in the style of depth in a painting
                        sumptuous for use, and briefly this
                        of fancy, pity, and devising,
                        wherefore as it is at the right door
                        make it language or rejoice
                        this is how you touch me in my other ghosts
                        & short of the occasion
                        just a frequent mist of atoms
                        all touching in the arms
                        like an error in the wish
The light’s seltzer, bubbles.
I said My lord. I thought
My god. O moonstruck. O gladracket. Barring
gravity, our knees could be forevering each other.

Barring leather, love is a world I’m praying
all my mothers’ joy back toward.

Elizabeth was my name. I’m writing this on all the trees like a wish.
I’m kissing every hem in sight.

We’re all hysterical & going nowhere together.

C’mon rapture. Let’s go bedazzling.

Nothing gets futured without its own spitshine
& I’m already not not not not not not miraculous.

beautiful, it is not. And if I’m being honest,

Glitz girls in the spackle. Teen climbed
The boughed over stair. Stole lace to begin again
In darkness, a fingering salt. Print
Delighted the line to lined
Pink. Was doll-sized, weighted out. Was flat-reaped sigh
And dollar bin plaid. Fridays we stayed in
Till in coughed through with dry heat. Men
Grew approximate in their longing for something to mine.
Sippy cup of burn, acrylic camel, and melting kohl
Was a hiding past boyish. We shone with miraculous
Droll. Don’t try to kiss me, she was always saying. Older
Than a watch, the girl who pays starch to hush
Meat. Gargantuan between grown and still us,
I leave her orange street, my wanting ode


my partner and I spend most of our time

on earth feeding one another citrus fruits

and enough strength to go on. Every morning

I pack them half a grapefruit and some sugar.

And they tell me it’s just sweet enough.

Dear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound,

I won’t. Get lucky. Get found.
But kegs run out, the hour brims,
the party flips its switches down,

his hips to mine, his arms around,
a song ends, and dark begins—
dear sip, dear shotgun, dear pound,
the party flips its switches down.
I remind her of a cookie in a dream she had of heaven or
hell—but which was it? Everything that happens in the
world has someone to say it’s their fault, repress it as
they may. The cutout in the cocktail bar wants to go
home with someone for once. The snakeskin hangs on
the gate like it’s a street corner, that each uttered “baby”
renews. Knowing can be a means to forgetting, also
We stand there as if the floor or wall is our companion
our fortress in trouble: mates a bit longer, keeping sex at
bay. Not everyone looks where they’re going or cares

where others are. They’re the rugged ones, though fleet
as moths when crossing a highway. Sometimes, despite
our own egos, we admire this, as if wise that the pattern
of the one ahead won’t ultimately save or brave us
Don’t rush. The star we wake to mightn’t always be
there, so we wander outside as if air were itself a prayer
or someone’s. Is that for me? addressing an ivy or a wet
plank, suddenly hungry. Tell me what happened to Peter
and Wendy and the loser with the hook for a hand. Was
it all alright in the end? They say time is nothing but it

takes the saying to make it so. To be the one is to
vanquish Sinatra, but also life (not that life is patriarchy)
Repress the possibility for the sake of staying young, as
around the bend a boat may contain the set of problems
that will have always been around. Attitudes to dancing
housework, contraception, ever music’s themes. A wall-
flower may remind themselves of wallpaper, peeling to
reveal a peasant who goes to sleep at dusk behind their
tux, but does that haunt you more than the possibility
of possessing truth? Is that what your glances are about?

I am so small walking on the beach
at night under the widening sky.
The wet sand quickens beneath my feet
and the waves thunder against the shore.

I am moving away from the boardwalk
with its colorful streamers of people
and the hotels with their blinking lights.
The wind sighs for hundreds of miles.

I am disappearing so far into the dark
I have vanished from sight.
I am a tiny seashell
that has secretly drifted ashore

and carries the sound of the ocean
surging through its body.
I am so small now no one can see me.
How can I be filled with such a vast love?
I take her in my hands
I open her gently
I part her pages
I stare at her words
I want her letters in my mouth
I run my hand down her spine
I love reading her
I love making love to her
I let her fall asleep in my lap
I pledge to sit upright in my coffin
as soon as the morgue-ice melts, and turn
a cheek grayer than this dusk. Kiss it
even if it doesn’t remind you of yesterday,
but let your tact disregard the breath
of a corpse mingled with the musk
you emptied on my breast. The belched outrage
from a belly domed in gas is simply
my way of saying, “Honey, I’m home.”
The carrion fly counting the fibers
in my nose is no heavenly harbinger.
Discount it as you’d discount a bird
on a cliché and fear nothing for there’s nothing
left to fear. Darling, I’m in no hurry.
Take your time in bringing me a rose
of that pinot we once praised to the sky
and let my tongue gad about in a warm
crimson bay. I swear to lie back forever
when the stylus roundly vexes a scratch
He was first a snake and was in love with her—a she-snake. And then he molted and after he molted he was a turtle and he met another she-turtle and fell in love with her. When he deshelled after years, he became a four-legged animal, black spots sprouting over his fur, and he fell for a leopard. He moved this way through the jungles, the savannas, the deserts, the skies, through the oceans, the air, the land and beneath it, changing and changing and meeting and falling in love with new she-species.
 
The lovers he left behind did not change. They were who they were. The same.
 
They were individualistic so to speak, but now they were also heartbroken and full of hate for him—the one who had left in the middle of, sometimes, passionate lovemaking.
 
They had no idea how it was to live so many lives in one life like him.

To take no breaks with rebirths from being mosquito to man.

Sometimes evolution and progress is so fast, blessings and curses are all mixed up, and One.
Forgive me.
I say to the wall.
My life is paper.
My jaws rust.

Wanderer: singing.
The sky is my home.
I throw roses into it
to color it red.

Stop: these roads
grow from me.
My journey must end
because my destinations
have ended.

Kneeling like a priest,
seeing the spherical eyes
of flies, my wish:
emptiness and sudden light.

Resurrection: I am dead
from it—the attempt to live
again.

It sings as me when I sleep:
the world dressed in yellow.
Never have songs
meant for me what they do
when you sing.

I leave you: haloes and clothes.
I leave you violently.
Like the wail of an exile.

Forget me: my truth.
My masterpiece is
my nonexistence.

Sunrise: unbreakable dawn.
I open your book.
It has no pages.


What will I take instead, you ask? Solenoid, ouroboros and African paayal: words we learnt from each other. Sputters of ??laughter over the misspelling of récipiendaire in my hundred-and-twenty-paged dissertation you went on to supervise. A first date with Patrice Chéreau’s Intimacy that left us bereft of voice but not touch. The spring lost in Paris, and retrieved in Rome: neonate but blithe and loud. Den Bosch and its soundless mornings, where even birds meditate. Dublin, yes, despite the disasters with missing kathak ankle bells and katana. Those shy cities that blush at dusk when the sun’s gaze fills with sudden desire. Others undressed by moonlight. The unsubsidized, incomplete report “Science and the Art of Rolling Balls and Other Machines.” All the lines of poetry you thought, and refused to write. The crackle and splutter of toast burning before breakfast. A tuneless humming muffled by shower curtains. Matinal half-hour radio-switch battles between RFI and BBC World. Sighting the smile on a natal cleft as you reach up for the tin of dark chocolate. Haroun and the Sea of Stories and Invisible Cities, more mine than yours: yes, I can play dirty on this. Canal Saint-Martin—but only the curve between the café Le Valmy and Pont de la Grange-aux-Belles. Koodiyattam as a birthday surprise when the gods left their paddy fields and invaded Paris, complete with cobalt and emerald cheeks, human woes and joys. The first encounter with Pina Bausch’s Café Müller. Every single one with her Rite of Spring. My fear of dying alone in a strange city at night. Copper and caramel: the two shades your gaze seems to traverse between dusk and daybreak. Other constellations: Pisces and Lynx and Phoenix. The ancient fleece jacket each would wear when the other was not around. All of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld books we owned together. The word together, as well. The fact you shared aloud in surprise at tea: a giraffe’s heart weighs an incredible 24 pounds. Today. Tomorrow. A spring tide of tomorrows

Our granaries flowed with deposits of sweetest kernels
Like squirrels we were the saviors of a future
In winter’s clamp we siphoned liqueurs using deep-stemmed waterlilies
Returning to redeem we found brittle rock-sugar
Clouded air traps
Ice spikes
Fossil prints

—

Whenever I open my mouth: crater

Blisters I take for moonwalking shoes

Sentries out the front
Slips at the backdoor

The bloat floats

Fatwrapped
Fleafeeling

—

Two people have a third person between them
One of them is always responsible for her disappearance

Parched beehives in their stomachs they look everywhere

Lightning and smoke form duration in the I Ching clouds
She won’t say shoo
We must be
the inviolate
petals, always
queering to-
ward the sun,
must be water
on the lips of
flaming cities,
quenching
the husbands,
insatiable. These
days the abdomen
blossoms, but
we must be
boneless, edible
fish. We must
beg for bouquets
for absent sons.
This is how we
know devotion:
listening to lovers
sleep, breathing
like monster trucks,
wanting to soothe
them when the dream
is done. We march
the sinking avenues,
finger the curls
at the baby’s neck,
hanging from
the brink at
office hour,
gulping Xanax
in their white
oblong shells.
Cities can sleep
but we can never.
Vigilant animals
on our hands and
knees, asking for
Each temple is an offering made to the gods
by giving them a home.
Did you ever feel this. Astonished
by the blood drawn from
your arms when you took a step forward
and the air scraped you.

Maybe you think peace. Think it
as a floral carpet, a persistent scent
that is supposed to be
a memory you treasure. Only
it was put there by someone else.

When the sun hits
it feels like something.
Someone cooks soup.
You love a person you envy.
And the emotions wash
into a teacup
and you drink them
and your teeth are storm-stained.

If there were a wave,
blue-black, flooding lives out,
spinning each person
and the next
and their needs
together as if they were fabrics
in a laundry machine,
could I ever trust it? If I touch
and you forget
you have borders against nature.
We’re floating somewhere
in a primordial pool.
And I’ve got you, and I’ve got you.

An inward realization can only be achieved
by draining out your wealth and strength. So he went on
Another building rampage.
?“A world conquer campaign,” as my brother used to say.
Drew a straight line across a map
And let the priest and the architect connect
the fact that often it was a Queen
on whose insistence these stone gardens were built.

If I had known      all those     days
to listen deep   into myself      so that you

would begin      to hear      me,      I’d sooner
soak      the decibels      of      your cells

into  the exhale  of my      embrace.
            A scorning within       is within

                coming back      to scorn.
A rose quartz promise      lifted into

the world   is the world      coming back
                          to surrender      its love.

Even after      I took my health
into a vineyard      of hawks,

I could not break myself from caring
but only     to seek you,      find you,

            whisper into your palm:
you are not lost,      you won’t be lost.
What’s Godhead—
now standing upright,
fecundity no less
I tell you more about.

Phases of the moon, you see:
an auspicious moment I’ve
come to believe in with
Shiva or some other deity.

What Greece from antiquity
bestowed upon us with an
outsider named Sikander—
Alexander the Great going

to the Indus Valley but not
ancient Rome, I presume to
know less about; then it’s
Parvati, consort of Shiva,

being on the diurnal stage
as I dwell on enlightenment—
fires burning and smoke
rising from the ground.

Sandalwood, the ghee of life
with avatars coming closer,
and I will recite mantras
when Shiva looks back at me

from the corner of his eye
as I pretend I am in some
other place like Rishikesh,
close to the Ganges, but

here by the Rideau River—
this North with celestial fires,
making promises to myself
from long ago.
Then, the smaller, more regular ones: week-end washing, the family of filthy plates and pans and casseroles somersaulting well past burnished wooden spigots to be the first to greet me when arriving at your ancient garret in Angers by the last TGV, just grazing past midnight and the lone, last tram—with that recurrent, half-annoyed, half-amused, thought: would you first run out of copper and steel and stone, space in your cavernous sink or the resolve never to soap and scrub and rinse (drying’s all right)?  
 
Happier, low-maintenance rites as well: molten, dark hot chocolate brunches to celebrate impending surgery, yes, “celebrate” the verb we’d adopted as shaggy, wet-nosed mongrel, just right for consolation. The nights in hospital, where I knew—each time—you woke to place quiet fingers and parse the storm warnings within my breath. Then, the weeks of binge-relishing Wong Kar-wai films—from Ashes of Time to 2046 (we as “We” would not live to see My Blueberry Nights and Norah Jones)—for sustenance through rebirth and recovery, till I rose, irrevocably in love with Patrice Chéreau after Son  frère,  and,  it  is  true,  seldom  returned.  
 
All these and a few, more diffident, others went
missing in that one, endless, afternoon of our
remaindering, slipped away—unnoticed—
amidst the naming, the labeling, the
allotting, the packing. They could
have fled through the fissures
in the kitchen wall, or rolled
down cracks in the floor-
boards—and some, I
reckon, even threw
themselves out
of windows
we’d left
open.
            throb—

you do not know me if you graze
my saber & my light
but not the wound I guard.        1 accuses another
of everything but love.        1 demands

cameras, safety whistles, glue
to hold herself together
against the brutal gaze.      we only need
these awkward straps, heat-slick dildos,

Kutchi mirrors, concentric abstract
aurae of this crescent moon
sweeping our bodies w/ cool white
reflected & deflected light

because of what we’ve lost or left
because the language is disaster
because our species has forgotten
acute angles,

triple dream projected
—inner, outer, secret—
on empty, aching
temple walls.        afterward

the residue.      what isn’t conscious
throngs toward the surface:
10,000 joy-and-sorrow fishes
crashing into air.

He stood at the back of ?his old Church, wanting to join in with the congregation.
Everyone followed the priest,
I confess to almighty God, and to you my brothers and sisters, that
I have sinned through my own fault in my thoughts and in my words?...
He looked for her. The back of many black-haired heads made
his stomach upset. Heads all bent.

He glimpsed her thick plait curled on her shoulder by
the end of the Penitential Act. Moving, he saw her.
Always in a sari. Always with her mother.

Their son sat up on the altar, his shoes shinier
than all the other boys. His mother would have shone
them with Kiwi shoe polish and an old brush. The sound
would wake him. She must be watching him to keep
his face still. Her son on the altar at Morning Mass.

Their daughter was hand-in-hand with mother and
grandmother. Her two plaits shone with oil. After
the shoes, her mother would have woken and washed
her for Mass. She would tell the small girl Stop crying!
while tightly plaiting her thick-oiled hair.

He left before Communion started, walking down the road to the bus stop.

Pull down the crows from the sky
Piya, summer’s blood is barely dry
What is a poem if it cannot try
To call you a ****ing ***** or die
Whispering in your arms, this lie
When Kabira met Keats, he said:
Our poems make canopies overhead

Always

Or, beloved, if I told you
We are words
And the spaces between us
Make poetry
Would you not say
Piya, why the fuss?
We knew it was thus

 If you want definitions, here is one: a lover is one who waits.
Beauty is brief and violent
like the white thunderbolt
of Nilgiri slow and sudden
braided like her hair
one morning was a cluster
of grapes hung beside each
ear maybe it comes from where
hunger the voices of children
come breaking their way
to my heart the stones
my feet which are light
and heavy from walking
that path full and swift
the river flows eroding
the banks with its sinuous
desire gentle and unkind
the days the years boulders
tossed by a giant down the hill
we must climb to the sudden
sinuous blue
The next part, the part where definitions are unwoven and the threads laid bare, can be left to Barthes, Roland, who said everything about it that needs to be said. And for what cannot be (and there are still some of those things) there are films, which—no matter what the structuralists say—are not to be read.

There was a girl who sat every evening at a particular table, hoping it was close enough to where the boys sat to make it appear a natural veering off when (if) he came to sit at it, opposite her; but not close enough to make her seem desperate.

Not always was her waiting played out as gestures of solitude. Other people gave her company. There was nothing in her face that could be read as signs of biding. This did not mean that she knew her time was up. This did not mean that she ceased to wonder and hope and despair and curse.

This is where Barthes got the story of the mandarin wrong, the one who pined for the courtesan who had said that after the 100th night of waiting, she would be his. What Barthes did was to report the mandarin’s departure on the penultimate night. He didn’t say how, on the night the mandarin left, the courtesan had made up her mind to tell him he’d waited enough, he could come in and

 At the railway station I ask
if there’s a train to where you are.

I’m told there is one but it’s left already,
so has tomorrow’s and the day after’s.

Somewhere in the trees, painted in
degrees of green, the morning

paint still wet, a magpie robin sets up its
musical kit. You hear it in your garden,

I in mine. At night, like a colicky child,
our old bones tired, desire keeps us awake.

Put it to sleep if you can, I’ll do
the same, and for now let’s forget

the railway station. Parking’s not easy there,
the trains keep to no time.

Is it true that Troy lived life without a
written form before the Greeks invaded
with their horse, or did I learn that from a poem?
Either way, is that not how affection
ends, married or devoted to motion?
 
The upper hand forgetting how it felt
to feed the token, the brass first held in
the fingers then dropped into the subway vestibule.
This daily verb and its prescription cost,
on the rise from root to roof, would have you
 
be an estimate of man, could convince
you to never love another or another as he goes.
& if my looks one day be gone, my mood
will excuse my bad behavior. O trophies
of action, between which occasions suffocate,
 
& which boil into vapor, I should have seen X coming.
Not that anything would change the case, or more
Closely approximate the correct answer, but with the lawn
exposed I would not have to wonder when
it is you enter and when it is you leave.
 
            fills
my grave, you say.
 
Call it wait
            or rest—the stare,
the lunge back
 
into what we can’t
            swim—
Another shore now—
 
how our arms flail
            the joints’
acidic burn—
 
A hunger     
            unbeknownst
to us, a flame cupped
 
in skin—earth
           turning us
toward a thin stream
 
of self—Oh anticipant,
            Oh dear
loving Lord—to hold
 
a burden like a need
            and let
a new life begin.
 
   
LITTLE Ellie sits alone	
  ’Mid the beeches of a meadow	
    By a stream-side on the grass,	
And the trees are showering down	
  Doubles of their leaves in shadow	        5
    On her shining hair and face.	
 
She has thrown her bonnet by,	
  And her feet she has been dipping	
    In the shallow water’s flow:	
Now she holds them nakedly	        10
  In her hands, all sleek and dripping,	
    While she rocketh to and fro.	
 
Little Ellie sits alone,	
  And the smile she softly uses	
    Fills the silence like a speech	        15
While she thinks what shall be done,	
  And the sweetest pleasure chooses	
    For her future within reach.	
 
Little Ellie in her smile	
  Chooses—“I will have a lover,	        20
    Riding on a steed of steeds:	
He shall love me without guile,	
  And to him I will discover	
    The swan’s nest among the reeds.	
 
“And the steed shall be red-roan,	        25
  And the lover shall be noble,	
    With an eye that takes the breath:	
And the lute he plays upon	
  Shall strike ladies into trouble,	
    As his sword strikes men to death.	        30
 
“And the steed it shall be shod	
  All in silver, housed in azure,	
    And the mane shall swim the wind;	
And the hoofs along the sod	
  Shall flash onward and keep measure,	        35
    Till the shepherds look behind.	
 
“But my lover will not prize	
  All the glory that he rides in,	
    When he gazes in my face:	
He will say, ‘O Love, thine eyes	        40
  Build the shrine my soul abides in,	
    And I kneel here for thy grace!’	
 
“Then, ay, then he shall kneel low,	
  With the red-roan steed anear him	
    Which shall seem to understand,	        45
Till I answer, ‘Rise and go!	
  For the world must love and fear him	
    Whom I gift with heart and hand.’	
 
“Then he will arise so pale,	
  I shall feel my own lips tremble	        50
    With a yes I must not say,	
Nathless maiden-brave, ‘Farewell,’	
  I will utter, and dissemble—	
    ‘Light to-morrow with to-day!’	
 
“Then he’ll ride among the hills	        55
  To the wide world past the river,	
    There to put away all wrong;	
To make straight distorted wills,	
  And to empty the broad quiver	
    Which the wicked bear along.	        60
 
“Three times shall a young foot-page	
  Swim the stream and climb the mountain	
    And kneel down beside my feet—	
‘Lo, my master sends this gage,	
  Lady, for thy pity’s counting!	        65
    What wilt thou exchange for it?’	
 
“And the first time I will send	
  A white rosebud for a guerdon,	
    And the second time, a glove;	
But the third time—I may bend	        70
  From my pride, and answer—’Pardon,	
    If he comes to take my love.’	
 
“Then the young foot-page will run,	
  Then my lover will ride faster,	
    Till he kneeleth at my knee:	        75
‘I am a duke’s eldest son,	
  Thousand serfs do call me master,	
    But, O Love, I love but thee!’	
  
SEVEN maidens ’neath the midnight	
  Stand near the river-sea,	
Whose water sweepeth white around	
  The shadow of the tree.	
The moon and earth are face to face,	        5
  And earth is slumbering deep;	
The wave-voice seems the voice of dreams	
  That wander through her sleep.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
What bring they ’neath the midnight,	        10
  Beside the river-sea?	
They bring the human heart wherein	
  No nightly calm can be,—	
That droppeth never with the wind,	
  Nor drieth with the dew:	        15
O, calm it, God! Thy calm is broad	
  To cover spirits, too.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
The maidens lean them over	
  The waters, side by side,	        20
And shun each other’s deepening eyes,	
  And gaze adown the tide:	
For each within a little boat	
  A little lamp hath put,	
And heaped for freight some lily’s weight	        25
  Or scarlet rose half shut.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
Of a shell of cocoa carven,	
  Each little boat is made:	
Each carries a lamp, and carries a flower,	        30
  And carries a hope unsaid.	
And when the boat hath carried the lamp	
  Unquenched, till out of sight,	
The maidens are sure that love will endure,—	
  But love will fail with light.	        35
                The river floweth on.	
 
Why, all the stars are ready	
  To symbolize the soul,	
The stars untroubled by the wind,	
  Unwearied as they roll;	        40
And yet the soul by instinct sad	
  Reverts to symbols low,—	
To that small flame whose very name,	
  Breathed o’er it, shakes it so!	
                The river floweth on.	        45
 
Six boats are on the river,	
  Seven maidens on the shore,	
While still above them steadfastly	
  The stars shine evermore.	
Go, little boats, go soft and safe,	        50
  And guard the symbol spark!	
The boats aright go safe and bright	
  Across the waters dark.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
The maiden Luti watcheth	        55
  Where onwardly they float.	
That look in her dilating eyes	
  Might seem to drive her boat;	
Her eyes still mark the constant fire,	
  And kindling unawares	        60
That hopeful while she lets a smile	
  Creep silent through her prayers.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
The smile,—where hath it wandered?	
  She riseth from her knee,	        65
She holds her dark, wet locks away,—	
  There is no light to see!	
She cries a quick and bitter cry,	
  “Nuleeni, launch me thine!	
We must have light abroad to-night,	        70
  For all the wreck of mine.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“I do remember watching	
  Beside this river-bed,	
When on my childish knee was laid	        75
  My dying father’s head.	
I turned mine own, to keep the tears	
  From falling on his face,—	
What doth it prove when death and love	
  Choose out the selfsame place?”	        80
                The river floweth on.	
 
“They say the dead are joyful	
  The death-change here receiving.	
Who say,—all me! who dare to say	
  Where joy comes to the living?	        85
Thy boat, Nuleeni! look not sad,—	
  Light up the waters rather!	
I weep no faithless lover where	
  I wept a loving father.”	
                The river floweth on.	        90
 
“My heart foretold his falsehood	
  Ere my little boat grew dim:	
And though I closed mine eyes to dream	
  That one last dream of him,	
They shall not now be wet to see	        95
  The shining vision go:	
From earth’s cold love I look above	
  To the holy house of snow.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“Come thou,—thou never knewest	        100
  A grief, that thou shouldst fear one!	
Thou wearest still the happy look	
  That shines beneath a dear one!	
Thy humming-bird is in the sun,	
  Thy cuckoo in the grove,	        105
And all the three broad worlds, for thee	
  Are full of wandering love.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“Why, maiden, dost thou loiter?	
  What secret wouldst thou cover?	        110
That peepul cannot hide thy boat,	
  And I can guess thy lover:	
I heard thee sob his name in sleep,—	
  It was a name I knew,—	
Come, little maid, be not afraid,	        115
  But let us prove him true!”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
The little maiden cometh,	
  She cometh shy and slow;	
I ween she seeth through her lids,	        120
  They drop adown so low:	
Her tresses meet her small bare feet,—	
  She stands and speaketh naught,	
Yet blusheth red, as if she said	
  The name she only thought.	        125
                The river floweth on.	
 
She knelt beside the water,	
  She lighted up the flame,	
And o’er her youthful forehead’s calm	
  The fitful radiance came:	        130
“Go, little boat, go, soft and safe,	
  And guard the symbol spark!”	
Soft, safe, doth float the little boat	
  Across the waters dark.	
                The river floweth on.	        135
 
Glad tears her eyes have blinded;	
  The light they cannot reach:	
She turneth with that sudden smile	
  She learnt before her speech,—	
“I do not hear his voice! the tears	        140
  Have dimmed my light away!	
But the symbol light will last to-night,	
  The love will last for aye.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
Then Luti spake behind her,—	        145
  Outspake she bitterly:	
“By the symbol light that lasts to-night,	
  Wilt vow a vow to me?”	
Nuleeni gazeth up her face,—	
  Soft answer maketh she:	        150
“By loves that last when lights are past,	
  I vow that vow to thee!”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
An earthly look had Luti	
  Though her voice was deep as prayer,—	        155
“The rice is gathered from the plains	
  To cast upon thine hair;	
But when he comes, his marriage-band	
  Around thy neck to throw,	
Thy bride-smile raise to meet his gaze,	        160
And whisper,—There is one betrays,	
  When Luti suffers woe.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“And when in seasons after,	
  Thy little bright-faced son	        165
Shall kneel against thy knee and ask	
  What deeds his sire hath done,	
Press deeper down thy mother-smile	
  His glossy curls among,—	
View deep his pretty childish eyes,	        170
And whisper,—There is none denies,	
  When Luti speaks of wrong.”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
Nuleeni looked in wonder	
  Yet softly answered she,—	        175
“By loves that last when lights are past,	
  I vowed that vow to thee.	
But why glads it thee that a bride-day be	
  By a word of woe defiled?	
That a word of wrong take the cradle-song	        180
  From the ear of a sinless child?”	
  “Why,” Luti said, and her laugh was dread,	
  And her eyes dilated wild,—	
“That the fair new love may her bridegroom prove,	
  And the father shame the child.”	        185
                The river floweth on.

1893

THY face is far from this our war,	
  Our call and counter-cry,	
I shall not find Thee quick and kind,	
  Nor know Thee till I die.	
Enough for me in dreams to see	        5
  And touch Thy garments’ hem:	
Thy feet have trod so near to God	
  I may not follow them!	
 
Through wantonness if men profess	
  They weary of Thy parts,	        10
E’en let them die at blasphemy	
  And perish with their arts;	
But we that love, but we that prove	
  Thine excellence august,	
While we adore, discover more	        15
  Thee perfect, wise, and just.	
 
Since spoken word Man’s Spirit stirred	
  Beyond his belly-need,	
What is is Thine of fair design	
  In Thought and Craft and Deed.	        20
Each stroke aright of toil and fight,	
  That was and that shall be,	
And hope too high wherefore we die,	
  Has birth and worth in Thee.	
 
Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee	        25
  To gild his dross thereby,	
And knowledge sure that he endure	
  A child until he die—	
For to make plain that man’s disdain	
  Is but new Beauty’s birth—	        30
For to possess in singleness	
  The joy of all the earth.	
 
As Thou didst teach all lovers speech	
  And Life all mystery,	
So shalt Thou rule by every school	        35
  Till life and longing die,	
Who wast or yet the Lights were set,	
  A whisper in the Void,	
Who shalt be sung through planets young	
  When this is clean destroyed.	        40
 
Beyond the bounds our staring rounds,	
  Across the pressing dark,	
The children wise of outer skies	
  Look hitherward and mark	
A light that shifts, a glare that drifts,	        45
  Rekindling thus and thus,	
Not all forlorn, for Thou hast borne	
  Strange tales to them of us.	
 
Time hath no tide but must abide	
  The servant of Thy will;	        50
Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme	
  The ranging stars stand still—	
Regent of spheres that lock our fears	
  Our hopes invisible,	
Oh ’t was certes at Thy decrees	        55
  We fashioned Heaven and Hell!	
 
Pure Wisdom hath no certain path	
  That lacks thy morning-eyne,	
And Captains bold by Thee controlled	
  Most like to Gods design.	        60
Thou art the Voice to kingly boys	
  To lift them through the fight,	
And Comfortress of Unsuccess,	
  To give the Dead good-night.	
 
A veil to draw ’twixt God His Law	        65
  And Man’s infirmity,	
A shadow kind to dumb and blind	
  The shambles where we die;	
A rule to trick th’ arithmetic,	
  Too base, of leaguing odds—	        70
The spur of trust, the curb of lust,	
  Thou handmaid of the Gods!	
 
O Charity, all patiently	
  Abiding wrack and scaith!	
O Faith, that meets ten thousand cheats	        75
  Yet drops no jot of faith!	
Devil and brute Thou dost transmute	
  To higher, lordlier show,	
Who art in sooth that lovely Truth	
  The careless angels know!	        80
 
Thy face is far from this our war,	
  Our call and counter-cry,	
I may not find Thee quick and kind,	
  Nor know Thee till I die.	
 
Yet may I look with heart unshook	        85
  On blow brought home or missed—	
Yet may I hear with equal ear	
  The clarions down the List;	
Yet set my lance above mischance	
  And ride the barriere—	        90
Oh, hit or miss, how little ’t is,	
  My Lady is not there!
“Thou flowest still, O river,	
  Thou flowest ’neath the moon,—	
Thy lily hath not changed a leaf.	
  Thy charméd lute a tune!	        190
He mixed his voice with thine,—and his	
  Was all I heard around;	
But now, beside his chosen bride,	
  I hear the river’s sound.”	
                The river floweth on.	        195
 
“I gaze upon her beauty	
  Through the tresses that enwreathe it:	
The light above thy wave is hers,—	
  My rest, alone beneath it.	
O, give me back the dying look	        200
  My father gave thy water!	
Give back! and let a little love	
  O’erwatch his weary daughter!”	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“Give back!” she hath departed,—	        205
  The word is wandering with her,	
And the stricken maidens hear afar	
  The step and cry together.	
Frail symbols? None are frail enow	
  For mortal joys to borrow!	        210
While bright doth float Nuleeni’s boat,	
  She weepeth, dark with sorrow.	
                The river floweth on.	
 
“He will kiss me on the mouth	
  Then, and lead me as a lover	        80
    Through the crowds that praise his deeds:	
And, when soul-tied by one troth,	
  Unto him I will discover	
    That swan’s nest among the reeds.”	
 
Little Ellie, with her smile	        85
  Not yet ended, rose up gaily,	
    Tied the bonnet, donned the shoe,	
And went homeward, round a mile,	
  Just to see, as she did daily,	
    What more eggs were with the two.	        90
 
Pushing through the elm-tree copse,	
  Winding up the stream, light-hearted,	
    Where the osier pathway leads,	
Past the boughs she stoops—and stops.	
  Lo, the wild swan had deserted,	        95
    And a rat had knawed the reeds!	
 
Ellie went home sad and slow.	
  If she found the lover ever,	
    With his red-roan steed of steeds,	
Sooth I know not; but I know	        100
  She could never show him—never,	
    That swan’s nest among the reeds!	
 
FAIN 1 would I change that note	
To which fond Love hath charm’d me	
Long long ago to sing by rote,	
Fancying that that harm’d me:	
Yet when this thought doth come,	        5
‘Love is the perfect sum	
    Of all delight,’	
I have no other choice	
Either for pen or voice	
    To sing or write.	        10
 
O Love! they wrong thee much	
That say thy sweet is bitter,	
When thy rich fruit is such	
As nothing can be sweeter.	
Fair house of joy and bliss,	        15
Where truest pleasure is,	
    I do adore thee:	
I know thee what thou art,	
I serve thee with my heart,	
    And fall before thee.
I LOVE to steal awhile away	
  From every cumbering care,	
And spend the hours of setting day	
  In humble, grateful prayer.	
 
I love, in solitude, to shed	        5
  The penitential tear;	
And all His promises to plead,	
  When none but God can hear.	
 
I love to think on mercies past,	
  And future good implore;	        10
And all my cares and sorrows cast	
  On Him whom I adore.	
 
I love, by faith, to take a view	
  Of brighter scenes in heaven;	
The prospect doth my strength renew,	        15
  While here by tempests driven.	
 
Thus, when life’s toilsome day is o’er,	
  May its departing ray	
Be calm as this impressive hour,	
  And lead to endless day.

And so one day, as ever of old,	
  Hands out, they hurried, knee to knee;	       10
On fire to cling and kiss and hold	
  And, in the other’s eyes, to see	
  Each his own tiny face,	
  And in that long embrace	
  Feel lip and breast grow warm	       15
  To breast and lip and arm.	
  
So knee to knee they sped again,	
  And laugh to laugh they ran, I’m told,	
Across the streets of Hell…	
  And then	       20
  They suddenly felt the wind blow cold,	
  And knew, so closely pressed,	
  Chill air on lip and breast,	
  And, with a sick surprise,	
  The emptiness of eyes.

THE hunchèd camels of the night	 
Trouble the bright	 
And silver waters of the moon.	 
The Maiden of the Morn will soon	 
Through Heaven stray and sing,	         5
Star gathering.	 
  
Now while the dark about our loves is strewn,	 
Light of my dark, blood of my heart, O come!	 
And night will catch her breath up, and be dumb.	 
  
Leave thy father, leave thy mother	  10
And thy brother;	 
Leave the black tents of thy tribe apart!	 
Am I not thy father and thy brother,	 
And thy mother?	 
And thou—what needest with thy tribe's black tents	  15
Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?
    Foul evil of the joys he may not share!	
There is no stain in love; the only sin	
    Is his who scorns the garb of love to wear.	
 
Sweet home of passion, nest of mated hearts	
    Quick throbbing each to each in wild desire;	        10
Till swift, resistless, through each pulse and vein	
    Leaps quivering forth love’s own magnetic fire.	
 
O wretched, empty lives, that never knew	
    The thrill of love’s ecstatic, fierce embrace!	
When, lips to lips tight pressed, heart beats to heart,	        15
    With hot, sharp breaths; and love-fired limbs enlace.	
 
Thy sweet will, love, be done! From that blest couch	
    Fond lovers may not rise unsatisfied;	
Denied the crowning act of perfect bliss,	
    When being into being seems to glide.	        20
 
Rest, loving hearts, in blissful lassitude,	
    Still tightly clasped in soft, encircling arms.	
Sleep, sweetly sleep, to wake and taste again	
    The maddening richness of each other’s charms.	
 
Love’s hour is brief, but crowned with wealth beyond	        25
    The brightest splendors of the loveless years.	
The thrones of monarchs and the seats of gods	
    Shrink all to naught in love’s bright smiles or tears.	
 
Best home of love! To many an amorous fray	
    We vow thy snowy sheets to dedicate;	        30
That bards to come, in oft-repeated strains,	
    Thy perfect hours may long commemorate.
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,	        15
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes	
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,	
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,	
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,	
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,	        20
And seeing that it was a soft October night,	
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.	
 WHAT meaneth this! when I lie alone	
I toss, I turn, I sigh, I groan;	
My bed me seems as hard as stone:	
        What means this?	
I sigh, I plain continually;	        5
The clothes that on my bed do lie,	
Always me think they lie awry;	
        What means this?	
In slumbers oft for fear I quake;	
For heat and cold I burn and shake;	        10
For lack of sleep my head doth ake;	
        What means this?	
A mornings then when I do rise,	
I turn unto my wonted guise,	
All day after muse and devise;	        15
        What means this?	
And if perchance by me there pass,	
She, unto whom I sue for grace,	
The cold blood forsaketh my face;	
        What means this?	        20
But if I sit near her by,	
With loud voice my heart doth cry,	
And yet my mouth is dumb and dry;	
        What means this?	
To ask for help no heart I have;	        25
My tongue doth fail what I should crave;	
Yet inwardly I rage and rave;	
        What means this?	
Thus have I passed many a year,	
And many a day, though nought appear,	        30
But most of that that most I fear;	
        What means this?
And indeed there will be time	
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,	
Rubbing its back upon the window panes;	        25
There will be time, there will be time	
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;	
There will be time to murder and create,	
And time for all the works and days of hands	
That lift and drop a question on your plate;	        30
Time for you and time for me,	
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,	
And for a hundred visions and revisions,	
Before the taking of a toast and tea.	
 
In the room the women come and go	        35
Talking of Michelangelo.	
 
And indeed there will be time	
To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”	
Time to turn back and descend the stair,	
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—	        40
(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)	
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,	
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—	
(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)	
Do I dare	        45
Disturb the universe?	
In a minute there is time	
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.	
 
For I have known them all already, known them all:	
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,	        50
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;	
I know the voices dying with a dying fall	
Beneath the music from a farther room.	
  So how should I presume?	
 
And I have known the eyes already, known them all—	        55
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,	
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,	
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,	
Then how should I begin	
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?	        60
  And how should I presume?	
 
And I have known the arms already, known them all—	
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare	
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)	
Is it perfume from a dress	        65
That makes me so digress?	
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.	
  And should I then presume?	
  And how should I begin?
.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .
Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets	        70
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes	
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?…	
 
I should have been a pair of ragged claws	
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .
And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!	        75
Smoothed by long fingers,	
Asleep … tired … or it malingers,	
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.	
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,	
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?	        80
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,	
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,	
I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;	
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,	
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,	        85
And in short, I was afraid.	
 
And would it have been worth it, after all,	
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,	
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,	
Would it have been worth while,	        90
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,	
To have squeezed the universe into a ball	
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,	
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,	
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—	        95
If one, settling a pillow by her head,	
  Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;	
  That is not it, at all.”	
 
And would it have been worth it, after all,	
Would it have been worth while,	        100
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,	
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—	
And this, and so much more?—	
It is impossible to say just what I mean!	
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:	        105
Would it have been worth while	
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,	
And turning toward the window, should say:	
  “That is not it at all,	
  That is not what I meant, at all.”
.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .
        110
No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;	
Am an attendant lord, one that will do	
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,	
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,	
Deferential, glad to be of use,	        115
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;	
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;	
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—	
Almost, at times, the Fool.	
 
I grow old … I grow old …	        120
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.	
 
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?	
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.	
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.	
 
I do not think that they will sing to me.	        125
 
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves	
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back	
When the wind blows the water white and black.	
 
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea	
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown	        130
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.


LOVE bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,	 
      Guilty of dust and sin.	 
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack	 
      From my first entrance in,	 
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning	         5
      If I lack'd anything.	 
 
'A guest,' I answer'd, 'worthy to be here:'	 
     Love said, 'You shall be he.'	 
'I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,	 
      I cannot look on Thee.'	  10
Love took my hand and smiling did reply,	 
      'Who made the eyes but I?'	 
 
'Truth, Lord; but I have marr'd them: let my shame	 
      Go where it doth deserve.'	 
'And know you not,' says Love, 'Who bore the blame?'	  15
      'My dear, then I will serve.'	 
'You must sit down,' says Love, 'and taste my meat.'	 
      So I did sit and eat.	 

MY Spectre around me night and day	
Like a wild beast guards my way;	
My Emanation far within	
Weeps incessantly for my sin.	
 
‘A fathomless and boundless deep,	        5
There we wander, there we weep;	
On the hungry craving wind	
My Spectre follows thee behind.	
 
‘He scents thy footsteps in the snow	
Wheresoever thou dost go,	       10
Thro’ the wintry hail and rain.	
When wilt thou return again?	
 
’Dost thou not in pride and scorn	
Fill with tempests all my morn,	
And with jealousies and fears	       15
Fill my pleasant nights with tears?	
 
‘Seven of my sweet loves thy knife	
Has bereavèd of their life.	
Their marble tombs I built with tears,	
And with cold and shuddering fears.	       20
 
‘Seven more loves weep night and day	
Round the tombs where my loves lay,	
And seven more loves attend each night	
Around my couch with torches bright.	
 
‘And seven more loves in my bed	       25
Crown with wine my mournful head,	
Pitying and forgiving all	
Thy transgressions great and small.	
 
‘When wilt thou return and view	
My loves, and them to life renew?	       30
When wilt thou return and live?	
When wilt thou pity as I forgive?’	
 
‘O’er my sins thou sit and moan:	
Hast thou no sins of thy own?	
O’er my sins thou sit and weep,	       35
And lull thy own sins fast asleep.	
 
‘What transgressions I commit	
Are for thy transgressions fit.	
They thy harlots, thou their slave;	
And my bed becomes their grave.	       40
 
‘Never, never, I return:	
Still for victory I burn.	
Living, thee alone I’ll have;	
And when dead I’ll be thy grave.	
 
‘Thro’ the Heaven and Earth and Hell	       45
Thou shalt never, quell:	
I will fly and thou pursue:	
Night and morn the flight renew.’	
 
‘Poor, pale, pitiable form	
That I follow in a storm;	       50
Iron tears and groans of lead	
Bind around my aching head.	
  
LOVE, 1 lift me up upon thy golden wings	
From this base world unto thy heaven’s hight,	
Where I may see those admirable things	
Which there thou workest by thy soveraine might,	
Farre above feeble reach of earthly sight,	        5
That I thereof an heavenly hymne may sing	
Unto the God of Love, high heaven’s King.	
 
Many lewd layes (ah! woe is me the more!)	
In praise of that mad fit which fooles call Love,	
I have in th’ heate of youth made heretofore,	        10
That in light wits did loose affection move:	
But all these follies now I do reprove,	
And turned have the tenor of my string,	
The heavenly prayses of true Love to sing.	
 
And ye, that wont with greedy vaine desire	        15
To reade my fault, and, wondring at my flame,	
To warme yourselves at my wide sparckling fire,	
Sith now that heat is quenched, quench my blame,	
And in her ashes shrowd my dying shame;	
For who my passed follies now pursewes,	        20
Beginnes his owne, and my old fault renewes.	
 
BEFORE THIS WORLD’S GREAT FRAME, in which al things	
Are now contained, found any being-place,	
Ere flitting Time could wag his eyas wings	
About that mightie bound which doth embrace	        25
The rolling spheres, and parts their houres by space,	
That High Eternall Powre, which now doth move	
In all these things, mov’d in its selfe by love.	
 
It lov’d it selfe, because it selfe was faire;	
(For fair is lov’d;) and of it self begot	        30
Like to it selfe his eldest Sonne and Heire,	
Eternall, pure, and voide of sinfull blot,	
The firstling of His ioy, in whom no iot	
Of love’s dislike or pride was to be found,	
Whom He therefore with equall honour crown’d.	        35
 
With Him he raign’d, before all time prescribed,	
In endlesse glorie and immortall might,	
Together with that Third from them derived,	
Most wise, most holy, most almightie Spright!	
Whose kingdome’s throne no thoughts of earthly wight	        40
Can comprehend, much lesse my trembling verse	
With equall words can hope it to reherse.	
 
Yet, O most blessed Spright! pure lampe of light,	
Eternall spring of grace and wisedom trew,	
Vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright	        45
Some little drop of thy celestiall dew,	
That may my rymes with sweet infuse embrew,	
And give me words equall unto my thought,	
To tell the marveiles by thy mercie wrought.	
 
Yet being pregnant still with powrefull grace,	        50
And full of fruitfull Love, that loves to get	
Things like himselfe, and to enlarge his race,	
His second brood, though not of powre so great,	
Yet full of beautie, next He did beget	
An infinite increase of angels bright,	        55
All glistring glorious in their Maker’s light.	
 
To them the heaven’s illimitable hight	
(Not this round heaven, which we from hence behold,	
Adorn’d with thousand lamps of burning light,	
And with ten thousand gemmes of shyning gold,	        60
He gave as their inheritance to hold,	
That they might serve Him in eternall blis,	
And be partakers of these ioyes of His.	
 
There they in their trinall triplicities	
About Him wait, and on His will depend,	        65
Either with nimble wings to cut the skies,	
When He them on His messages doth send,	
Or on His owne dread presence to attend,	
Where they behold the glorie of His light,	
And caroll hymnes of love both day and night.	        70
 
Both day and night is unto them all one;	
For He His beames doth unto them extend,	
That darknesse there appeareth never none;	
Ne hath their day, ne hath their blisse, an end.	
But there their termelesse time in pleasure spend:	        75
Ne ever should their happinesse decay,	
Had not they dar’d their Lord to disobay.	
 
But pride, impatient of long resting peace,	
Did puffe them up with greedy bold ambition,	
That they gan cast their state how to increase	        80
Above the fortune of their first condition,	
And sit in God’s own seat without commission:	
The brightest angel, even the child of Light,	
Drew millions more against their God to fight.	
 
Th’ Almighty, seeing their so bold assay,	        85
Kindled the flame of His consuming yre,	
And with His onely breath them blew away	
From heaven’s hight, to which they did aspyre,	
To deepest hell and lake of damned fyre;	
Where they in darknesse and dread horror dwell,	        90
Hating the happie light from which they fell.	
 
So that next off-spring of the Maker’s love,	
Next to Himselfe in glorious degree,	
Degendering to hate, fell from above	
Through pride, (for pride and love may ill agree,)	        95
And now of sinne to all ensample bee:	
How then can sinnful flesh it selfe assure,	
Sith purest angels fell to be impure?	
 
But that Eternall Fount of love and grace,	
Still flowing forth His goodnesse unto all,	        100
Now seeing left a waste and emptie place	
In His wyde pallace, through those angels’ fall,	
Cast to supply the same, and to enstall	
A new unknowen colony therein,	
Whose root from earth’s base groundworke should begin.	        105
 
Therefore of clay, base, vile, and next to nought,	
Yet form’d by wondrous skill, and by His might	
According to an heavenly patterne wrought,	
Which He had fashioned in his wise foresight,	
He man did make, and breath’d a living spright	        110
Into his face, most beautifull and fayre,	
Endewd with wisedome’s riches, heavenly, rare.	
 
Such He him made, that he resemble might	
Himselfe, as mortall thing immortall could;	
Him to be lord of every living wight	        115
He made by love out of his owne like mould,	
In whom He might His mightie selfe behould:	
For Love doth love the thing belov’d to see,	
That like it selfe in lovely shape may bee.	
 
But man, forgetfull of his Maker’s grace	        120
No lesse than Angels, whom he did ensew,	
Fell from the hope of promist heavenly place	
Into the mouth of Death, to sinners dew,	
And all his offspring into thraldome threw,	
Where they for ever should in bonds remaine	        125
Of never-dead yet ever-dying paine:	
 
Till that great Lord of Love, which him at first	
Made of meere love, and after liked well,	
Seeing him lie like creature long accurst	
In that deep horror of despeyred hell,	        130
Him, wretch, in doole would let no longer dwell,	
But cast out of that bondage to redeeme,	
And pay the price, all were his debt extreeme.	
 
Out of the bosome of eternall blisse,	
In which He reigned with His glorious Syre,	        135
He downe descended, like a most demisse	
And abiect thrall, in fleshes fraile attyre,	
That He for him might pay sinne’s deadly hyre,	
And him restore unto that happie state	
In which he stood before his haplesse fate.	        140
 
In flesh at first the guilt committed was,	
Therefore in flesh it must be satisfyde;	
Nor spirit, nor angel, though they man surpas,	
Could make amends to God for man’s misguyde,	
But onely man himselfe, who selfe did slyde:	        145
So, taking flesh of sacred virgin’s wombe,	
For man’s deare sake He did a man become.	
 
And that most blessed bodie, which was borne	
Without all blemish or reprochfull blame,	
He freely gave to be both rent and torne	        150
Of cruell hands, who with despightfull shame	
Revyling Him, that them most vile became,	
At length Him nayled on a gallow-tree,	
And slew the lust by most uniust decree.	
 
O huge and most unspeakeable impression	        155
Of Love’s deep wound, that pierst the piteous hart	
Of that deare Lord with so entyre affection,	
And, sharply launcing every inner part,	
Dolours of death into His soule did dart,	
Doing him die that never it deserved,	        160
To free His foes, that from His heast had swerved!	
 
What hart can feel least touch of so sore launch,	
Or thought can think the depth of so deare wound?	
Whose bleeding sourse their streames yet never staunch,	
But stil do flow, and freshly still redownd,	        165
To heale the sores of sinfull soules unsound,	
And clense the guilt of that infected cryme	
Which was enrooted in all fleshly slyme.	
 
O blessed Well of Love! O Floure of Grace!	
O glorious Morning-Starre! O Lampe of Light!	        170
Most lively image of thy Father’s face,	
Eternal King of Glorie, Lord of Might,	
Meeke Lambe of God, before all worlds behight,	
How can we Thee requite for all this good?	
Or what can prize that Thy most precious blood?	        175
 
Yet nought Thou ask’st in lieu of all this love,	
But love of us, for guerdon of thy paine:	
Ay me! what can us lesse than that behove?	
Had He required life for us againe,	
Had it beene wrong to ask His owne with gaine?	        180
He gave us life, He it restored lost;	
Then life were least, that us so little cost.	
 
But He our life hath left unto us free;	
Free that was thrall, and blessed that was band;	
Ne ought demaunds but that we loving bee,	        185
As He Himselfe hath lov’d us afore-hand,	
And bound therto with an eternall band,	
Him first to love that was so dearely bought,	
And next our brethren, to his image wrought.	
 
Him first to love great right and reason is,	        190
Who first to us our life and being gave,	
And after, when we fared had amisse,	
Us wretches from the second death did save;	
And last, the food of life, which now we have,	
Even He Himselfe, in his dear sacrament,	        195
To feede our hungry soules, unto us lent.	
 
Then next, to love our brethren, that were made	
Of that selfe mould, and that self Maker’s hand,	
That we, and to the same againe shall fade,	
Where they shall have like heritage of land,	        200
However here on higher steps we stand,	
Which also were with selfe-same price redeemed	
That we, however of us light esteemed.	
 
And were they not, yet since that loving Lord	
Commanded us to love them for His sake,	        205
Even for His sake, and for His sacred word,	
Which in His last bequest He to us spake,	
We should them love, and with their needs partake;	
Knowing that, whatsoe’er to them we give,	
We give to Him by whom we all doe live.	        210
 
Such mercy He by His most holy reede	
Unto us taught, and to approve it trew,	
Ensampled it by His most righteous deede,	
Shewing us mercie, (miserable crew!)	
That we the like should to the wretches shew,	        215
And love our brethren; thereby to approve	
How much Himselfe that loved us we love.	
 
Then rouze thyselfe, O Earth! out of thy soyle,	
In which thou wallowest like to filthy swyne,	
And doest thy mynd in durty pleasures moyle,	        220
Unmindfull of that dearest Lord of thyne;	
Lift up to Him thy heavie clouded eyne,	
That thou this soveraine bountie mayst behold,	
And read, through love, His mercies manifold.	
 
Beginne from first, where he encradled was	        225
In simple cratch, wrapt in a wad of hay	
Betweene the toylfull oxe and humble asse,	
And in what rags, and in how base aray,	
The glory of our heavenly riches lay,	
When Him the silly shepheards came to see,	        230
Whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee.	
 
From thence reade on the storie of His life,	
His humble carriage, His unfaulty wayes,	
His cancred foes, His fights, His toyle, His strife,	
His paines, His povertie, His sharpe assayes,	        235
Through which he past His miserable dayes,	
Offending none and doing good to all,	
Yet being malist both by great and small.	
 
And look at last, how of most wretched wights	
He taken was, betrayd, and false accused;	        240
How with most scornfull taunts and fell despights	
He was revyld, disgrast, and foule abused;	
How scourgd, how crownd, how buffeted, how brused;	
And lastly, how twixt robbers crucifyde	
With bitter wounds through hands, through feet, and syde.	        245
 
Then let thy flinty hart, that feeles no paine,	
Empierced be with pittifull remorse,	
And let thy bowels bleede in every vaine,	
At sight of His most sacred heavenly corse,	
So torne and mangled with malicious forse;	        250
And let thy soule, whose sins His sorrows wrought,	
Melt into teares, and grone in grieved thought.	
 
With sence whereof, whilest so thy softened spirit	
Is inly toucht, and humbled with meeke zeale	
Through meditation of His endlesse merit,	        255
Lift up thy mind to th’ Author of thy weale,	
And to His soveraine mercie doe appeale:	
Learne Him to love that loved thee so deare,	
And in thy brest His blessed image beare.	
 
With all thy hart, with all thy soule and mind,	        260
Thou must Him love, and His beheasts embrace:	
All other loves, with which the world doth blind	
Weake fancies, and stirre up affections base,	
Thou must renounce and utterly displace;	
And give thyselfe unto Him full and free,	        265
That full and freely gave Himselfe to thee.	
   TO the assembled folk	
At great St. Kavin’s spoke	
Young Brother Amiel on Christmas Eve;	
I give you joy, my friends,	
That as the round year ends,	        5
We meet once more for gladness by God’s leave.	
 
On other festal days	
For penitence or praise	
Or prayer we meet, or fullness of thanksgiving;	
To-night we calendar	       10
The rising of that star	
Which lit the old world with new joy of living.	
 
Ah, we disparage still	
The Tidings of Good Will,	
Discrediting Love’s gospel now as then!	       15
And with the verbal creed	
That God is love indeed,	
Who dares make Love his god before all men?	
 
Shall we not, therefore, friends,	
Resolve to make amends	       20
To that glad inspiration of the heart;	
To grudge not, to cast out	
Selfishness, malice, doubt,	
Anger and fear; and for the better part,	
 
To love so much, so well,	       25
The spirit cannot tell	
The range and sweep of her own boundary!	
There is no period	
Between the soul and God;	
Love is the tide, God the eternal sea.…	       30
 
To-day we walk by love;	
To strive is not enough,	
Save against greed and ignorance and might.	
We apprehend peace comes	
Not with the roll of drums,	       35
But in the still processions of the night.	
 
And we perceive, not awe	
But love is the great law	
That binds the world together safe and whole.	
The splendid planets run	       40
Their courses in the sun;	
Love is the gravitation of the soul.	
 
In the profound unknown,	
Illumined, fair, and lone,	
Each star is set to shimmer in its place.	       45
In the profound divine	
Each soul is set to shine,	
And its unique appointed orbit trace.	
 
There is no near nor far,	
Where glorious Algebar	       50
Swings round his mighty circuit through the night,	
Yet where without a sound	
The winged seed comes to ground,	
And the red leaf seems hardly to alight.	
 
One force, one lore, one need	       55
For satellite and seed,	
In the serene benignity for all.	
Letting her time-glass run	
With star-dust, sun by sun,	
In Nature’s thought there is no great nor small.	       60
 
There is no far nor near	
Within the spirit’s sphere.	
The summer sunset’s scarlet-yellow wings	
Are tinged with the same dye	
That paints the tulip’s ply.	       65
And what is colour but the soul of things?	
 
(The earth was without form;	
God moulded it with storm,	
Ice, flood, and tempest, gleaming tint and hue;	
Lest it should come to ill	       70
For lack of spirit still,	
He gave it colour,—let the love shine through.)…	
 
Of old, men said, ‘Sin not;	
By every line and jot	
Ye shall abide; man’s heart is false and vile.’	       75
Christ said, ‘By love alone	
In man’s heart is God known;	
Obey the word no falsehood can defile.’…	
 
And since that day we prove	
Only how great is love,	       80
Nor to this hour its greatness half believe.	
For to what other power	
Will life give equal dower,	
Or chaos grant one moment of reprieve!	
 
Look down the ages’ line,	       85
Where slowly the divine	
Evinces energy, puts forth control;	
See mighty love alone	
Transmuting stock and stone,	
Infusing being, helping sense and soul.	       90
 
And what is energy,	
In-working, which bids be	
The starry pageant and the life of earth?	
What is the genesis	
Of every joy and bliss,	       95
Each action dared, each beauty brought to birth?	
 
What hangs the sun on high?	
What swells the growing rye?	
What bids the loons cry on the Northern lake?	
What stirs in swamp and swale,	      100
When April winds prevail,	
And all the dwellers of the ground awake?…	
   O NECTAR! O delicious stream!	
      O ravishing and only pleasure! Where	
      Shall such another theme	
Inspire my tongue with joys or please mine ear!	
      Abridgement of delights!	        5
        And Queen of sights!	
O mine of rarities! O Kingdom wide!	
O more! O cause of all! O glorious Bride!	
  O God! O Bride of God! O King!	
  O soul and crown of everything!	       10
 
    Did not I covet to behold	
Some endless monarch, that did always live	
    In palaces of gold,	
Willing all kingdoms, realms, and crowns to give	
    Unto my soul! Whose love	       15
      A spring might prove	
Of endless glories, honours, friendships, pleasures,	
Joys, praises, beauties and celestial treasures!	
  Lo, now I see there’s such a King,	
  The fountain-head of everything!	       20
 
    Did my ambition ever dream	
Of such a Lord, of such a love! Did I	
    Expect so sweet a stream	
As this at any time! Could any eye	
    Believe it! Why all power	       25
      Is used here;	
Joys down from Heaven on my head do shower,	
And Jove beyond the fiction doth appear	
  Once more in golden rain to come	
  To Danae’s pleasing fruitful womb.	       30
  
LOVE, lift me up upon thy golden wings,	
From this base world unto thy heavens hight,	
Where I may see those admirable things	
Which there thou workest by thy soveraine might,	
Farre above feeble reach of earthly sight,	        5
That I thereof an heavenly hymne may sing	
Unto the God of Love, high heavens king.	
 
Many lewd layes (ah, woe is me the more!)	
In praise of that mad fit which fooles call love,	
I have in th’ heat of youth made heretofore,	        10
That in light wits did loose affection move.	
But all those follies now I do reprove,	
And turned have the tenor of my string,	
The heavenly prayses of true love to sing.	
 
And ye that wont with greedy vaine desire	        15
To reade my fault, and wondring at my flame,	
To warme your selves at my wide sparckling fire,	
Sith now that heat is quenched, quench my blame,	
And in her ashes shrowd my dying shame:	
For who my passed follies now pursewes,	        20
Beginnes his owne, and my old fault renewes.	
 
BEFORE this worlds great frame, in which al things	
Are now containd, found any being place,	
Ere flitting Time could wag his eyas wings	
About that mightie bound, which doth embrace	        25
The rolling spheres, and parts their houres by space,	
That high eternall Powre, which now doth move	
In all these things, mov’d in it selfe by love.	
 
It lov’d it selfe, because it selfe was faire;	
(For faire is lov’d;) and of it selfe begot	        30
Like to it selfe his eldest Sonne and Heire,	
Eternall, pure, and voide of sinfull blot,	
The firstling of his joy, in whom no jot	
Of loves dislike or pride was to be found,	
Whom he therefore with equall honour crownd.	        35
 
With him he raignd, before all time prescribed,	
In endlesse glorie and immortall might,	
Together with that third from them derived,	
Most wise, most holy, most almightie Spright,	
Whose kingdomes throne no thought of earthly wight	        40
Can comprehend, much lesse my trembling verse	
With equall words can hope it to reherse.	
 
Yet, O most blessed Spirit, pure lampe of light,	
Eternall spring of grace and wisedome trew,	
Vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright	        45
Some little drop of thy celestiall dew,	
That may my rymes with sweet infuse embrew,	
And give me words equall unto my thought,	
To tell the marveiles by thy mercie wrought.	
 
Yet being pregnant still with powrefull grace,	        50
And full of fruitfull love, that loves to get	
Things like himselfe, and to enlarge his race,	
His second brood, though not in powre so great,	
Yet full of beautie, next he did beget,	
An infinite increase of angels bright,	        55

Therefore of clay, base, vile, and next to nought,	
Yet form’d by wondrous skill, and by his might,	
According to an heavenly patterne wrought,	
Which he had fashiond in his wise foresight,	
He man did make, and breathd a living spright	        110

Most lively image of thy Fathers face,

Meeke Lambe of God, before all worlds behight,	
How can we thee requite for all this good?	
Or what can prize that thy most precious blood?	        175
 
Yet nought thou ask’st in lieu of all this love,	
But love of us, for guerdon of thy paine.	
Ay me! what can us lesse then that behove?	
Had he required life of us againe,	
Had it beene wrong to aske his owne with gaine?	        180
He gave us life, he it restored lost;	
Then life were least, that us so litle cost.	
 
But he our life hath left unto us free,	
Free that was thrall, and blessed that was band;	
Ne ought demaunds, but that we loving bee,	        185
As he himselfe hath lov’d us afore hand,	
And bound therto with an eternall band,	
Him first to love, that us so dearely bought,	
And next, our brethren, to his image wrought.	
 
Him first to love, great right and reason is,	        190
Who first to us our life and being gave;	
And after, when we fared had amisse,	
Us wretches from the second death did save;	
And last, the food of life, which now we have,	
Even himselfe in his deare sacrament,	        195
To feede our hungry soules, unto us lent.	
 
Then next, to love our brethren, that were made	
Of that selfe mould and that selfe Makers hand	
That we, and to the same againe shall fade,	
Where they shall have like heritage of land,	        200
How ever here on higher steps we stand;	
Which also were with selfe same price redeemed	
That we, how ever of us light esteemed.	
 
And were they not, yet since that loving Lord	
Commaunded us to love them for his sake,	        205
Even for his sake, and for his sacred word,	
Which in his last bequest he to us spake,	
We should them love, and with their needs partake;	
Knowing that whatsoere to them we give,	
We give to him, by whom we all doe live.	        210
 
Such mercy he by his most holy reede	
Unto us taught, and to approve it trew,	
Ensampled it by his most righteous deede,	
Shewing us mercie, miserable crew!	
That we the like should to the wretches shew,	        215
And love our brethren; thereby to approve	
How much himselfe, that loved us, we love.	
 
Then rouze thy selfe, O Earth, out of thy soyle,	
In which thou wallowest like to filthy swyne,	
And doest thy mynd in durty pleasures moyle,	        220
Unmindfull of that dearest Lord of thyne;	
Lift up to him thy heavie clouded eyne,	
That thou his soveraine bountie mayst behold,	
And read through love his mercies manifold.	
 
Beginne from first, where he encradled was	        225
In simple cratch, wrapt in a wad of hay,	
Betweene the toylefull oxe and humble asse,	
And in what rags, and in how base aray,	
The glory of our heavenly riches lay,	
When him the silly shepheards came to see,	        230
Whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee.	
 
From thence reade on the storie of his life,	
His humble carriage, his unfaulty wayes,	
His cancred foes, his fights, his toyle, his strife,	
His paines, his povertie, his sharpe assayes	        235
Through which he past his miserable dayes,	
Offending none, and doing good to all,	
Yet being malist both of great and small.	
 
And looke at last, how of most wretched wights	
He taken was, betrayd, and false accused;	        240
How with most scornefull taunts, and fell despights,	
He was revyld, disgrast, and foule abused,	
How scourgd, how crownd, how buffeted, how brused;	
And lastly, how twixt robbers crucifyde,	
With bitter wounds through hands, through feet, and syde.	        245
 
Then let thy flinty hart, that feeles no paine,	
Empierced be with pittifull remorse,	
And let thy bowels bleede in every vaine,	
At sight of his most sacred heavenly corse,	
So torne and mangled with malicious forse,	        250
And let thy soule, whose sins his sorrows wrought,	
Melt into teares, and grone in grieved thought.	
 
LOVE is anterior to life,	
  Posterior to death,	
Initial of creation, and	
  The exponent of breath.	


I PLAY'D with you 'mid cowslips blowing,	 
  When I was six and you were four;	 
When garlands weaving, flower-balls throwing,	 
  Were pleasures soon to please no more.	 
Through groves and meads, o'er grass and heather,	         5
  With little playmates, to and fro,	 
We wander'd hand in hand together;	 
  But that was sixty years ago.	 
 
You grew a lovely roseate maiden,	 
  And still our early love was strong;	  10
Still with no care our days were laden,	 
  They glided joyously along;	 
And I did love you very dearly,	 
  How dearly words want power to show;	 
I thought your heart was touch'd as nearly;	  15
  But that was fifty years ago.	 
 
Then other lovers came around you,	 
  Your beauty grew from year to year,	 
And many a splendid circle found you	 
  The centre of its glimmering sphere.	  20
I saw you then, first vows forsaking,	 
  On rank and wealth your hand bestow;	 
O, then I thought my heart was breaking!—	 
  But that was forty years ago.	 
  
(From the Fourth Book; translated by John Dryden)

THUS, therefore, he who feels the fiery dart	
Of strong desire transfix his amorous heart,	
Whether some beauteous boy’s alluring face,	
Or lovelier maid, with unresisting grace,	
From her each part the winged arrow sends,	        5
From whence he first was struck he thither tends;	
Restless he roams, impatient to be freed,	
And eager to inject the sprightly seed;	
For fierce desire does all his mind employ,	
And ardent love assures approaching joy.	        10
Such is the nature of that pleasing smart,	
Whose burning drops distil upon the heart,	
The fever of the soul shot from the fair,	
And the cold ague of succeeding care.	
If absent, her idea still appears,	        15
And her sweet name is chiming in your ears.	
But strive those pleasing phantoms to remove,	
And shun the aerial images of love,	
That feed the flame; when one molests thy mind,	
Discharge thy loins on all the leaky kind;	        20
For that’s a wiser way than to restrain	
Within thy swelling nerves that hoard of pain.	
For every hour some deadlier symptom shows,	
And by delay the gathering venom grows,	
When kindly applications are not used;	        25
The viper, love, must on the wound be bruised:	
On that one object ’tis not safe to stay,	
But force the tide of thought some other way:	
The squandered spirits prodigally throw,	
And in the common globe of nature sow.	        30
Nor wants he all the bliss that lovers feign,	
Who takes the pleasure, and avoids the pain;	
For purer joys in purer health abound,	
And less affect the sickly than the sound.	
  When love its utmost vigor does employ,	        35
Even then ’tis but a restless wandering joy:	
Nor knows the lover in that wild excess,	
With hands or eyes, what first he would possess:	
But strains at all, and, fast’ning where he strains,	
Too closely presses with his frantic pains;	        40
With biting kisses hurts the twining fair,	
Which shows his joys imperfect, insincere:	
For, stung with inward rage, he flings around,	
And strives to avenge the smart on that which gave the wound.	
But love those eager bitings does restrain,	        45
And mingling pleasure mollifies the pain.	
For ardent hope still flatters anxious grief,	
And sends him to his foe to seek relief:	
Which yet the nature of the thing denies;	
For love, and love alone of all our joys,	        50
By full possession does but fan the fire;	
The more we still enjoy, the more we still desire.	
Nature for meat and drink provides a space,	
And, when received, they fill their certain place:	
Hence thirst and hunger may be satisfied;	        55
But this repletion is to love denied:	
Form, feature, colour, whatsoe’er delight	
Provokes the lover’s endless appetite,	
These fill no space, nor can we thence remove	
With lips, or hands, or all our instruments of love:	        60
In our deluded grasp we nothing find,	
But thin aerial shapes, that fleet before the mind.	
As he, who in a dream with drought is curst,	
And finds no real drink to quench his thirst;	
Runs to imagined lakes his heat to steep,	        65
And vainly swills and labors in his sleep;	
So love with phantoms cheats our longing eyes,	
Which hourly seeing never satisfies:	
Our hands pull nothing from the parts they strain,	
But wander o’er the lovely limbs in vain:	        70
Nor when the youthful pair more closely join,	
When hands in hands they lock, and thighs in thighs they twine,	
Just in the raging foam of full desire,	
When both press on, both murmur, both expire,	
They grip, they squeeze, their humid tongues they dart,	        75
As each would force their way to t’other’s heart:	
In vain; they only cruise about the coast;	
For bodies cannot pierce, nor be in bodies lost;	
As sure they strive to be, when both engage	
In that tumultuous momentary rage;	        80
So ’tangled in the nets of love they lie,	
Till man dissolves in that excess of joy.	
Then, when the gathered bag has burst its way,	
And ebbing tides the slackened nerves betray,	
A pause ensues; and nature nods awhile,	        85
Till with recruited rage new spirits boil;	
And then the same vain violence returns;	
With flames renewed the erected furnace burns.	
Again they in each other would be lost,	
But still by adamantine bars are crossed.	        90
All ways they try, successless all they prove,	
To cure the secret sore of ling’ring love.	
  Besides——	
They waste their strength in the venereal strife,	
And to a woman’s will enslave their life;	        95
The estate runs out, and mortgages are made;	
All offices of friendship are decayed;	
Their fortune ruined, and their fame betrayed.	
Assyrian ointment from their temples flows,	
And diamond buckles sparkle at their shoes.	        100
The cheerful emerald twinkles on their hands,	
With all the luxury of foreign lands:	
And the blue coat, that with embroid’ry shines,	
Is drunk with sweat of their o’er-labored loins.	
Their frugal fathers’ gains they misemploy,	        105
And turn to paint, and pearl, and ev’ry female toy.	
French fashions, costly treats are their delight;	
The park by day, and plays and balls by night.	
In vain:——	
For in the fountain, where their sweets are sought,	        110
Some bitter bubbles up, and poisons all the draught.	
First, guilty Conscience does the mirror bring,	
Then sharp Remorse shoots out her angry sting;	
And anxious thoughts, within themselves at strife,	
Upbraid the long misspent, luxurious life.	        115
Perhaps, the fickle fair one proves unkind,	
Or drops a doubtful word, that pains his mind,	
And leaves a rankling jealousy behind.	
Perhaps, he watches close her amorous eyes,	
And in the act of ogling does surprise;	        120
And thinks he sees upon her cheeks the while	
The dimpled tracks of some foregoing smile;	
His raging pulse beats thick, and his pent spirits boil.	
This is the product e’en of prosp’rous love:	
Think then what pangs disastrous passions prove!	        125
Innumerable ills; disdain, despair,	
With all the meager family of care.	
  Thus, as I said, ’tis better to prevent,	
Than flatter the disease, and late repent:	
Because to shun the allurement is not hard	        130
To minds resolved, forewarned, and well prepared;	
But wondrous difficult, when once beset,	
To struggle through the straits, and break the involving net.	
Yet, thus ensnared, thy freedom thou may’st gain,	
If, like a fool, thou dost not hug thy chain;	        135
If not to ruin obstinately blind,	
And wilfully endeavoring not to find	
Her plain defects of body and of mind.	
For thus the Bedlam train of lovers use	
T’ enhance the value, and the faults excuse;	        140
And therefore ’tis no wonder if we see	
They doat on dowdies and deformity;	
E’en what they cannot praise, they will not blame,	
But veil with some extenuating name:	
The sallow skin is for the swarthy put,	        145
And love can make a slattern of a slut.	
If cat-eyed, then a Pallas is their love;	
If freckled, she’s a party-coloured dove;	
If little, then she’s life and soul all o’er:	
An Amazon, the large two-handed whore.	        150
She stammers; oh what grace in lisping lies!	
If she says nothing, to be sure she’s wise.	
If shrill, and with a voice to drown a choir,	
Sharp-witted she must be, and full of fire.	
The lean, consumptive wench, with coughs decayed,	        155
Is called a pretty, tight, and slender maid.	
The o’ergrown, a goodly Ceres is exprest,	
A bed-fellow for Bacchus at the least.	
Flat-nose the name of Satyr never misses,	
And hanging blobber lips but pout for kisses.	        160
The task were endless all the rest to trace:	
Yet grant she were a Venus for her face	
And shape, yet others equal beauty share;	
And time was you could live without the fair;	
She does no more, in that for which you woo,	        165
Then homelier women full as well can do.	
Besides, she daubs; and stinks so much of paint,	
Her own attendants cannot bear the scent,	
But laugh behind, and bite their lips to hold;	
Meantime, excluded, and exposed to cold,	        170
The whining lover stands before the gates,	
And there with humble adoration waits:	
Crowning with flowers the threshold and the floor,	
And printing kisses on the obdurate door:	
Who, if admitted in that nick of time,	        175
If some unsav’ry whiff betray the crime,	
Invents a quarrel straight, if there be none,	
Or makes some faint excuses to be gone;	
And calls himself a doting fool to serve,	
Ascribing more than woman can deserve.	        180
Which well they understand like cunning queens;	
And hide their nastiness behind the scenes,	
From him they have allured, and would retain;	
But to a piercing eye ’tis all in vain:	
For common sense brings all their cheats to view,	        185
And the false light discovers by the true;	
Which a wise harlot owns, and hopes to find	
A pardon for defects, that run thro’ all the kind.	
  Nor always do they feign the sweets of love,	
When round the panting youth their pliant limbs they move,	        190
And cling, and heave, and moisten ev’ry kiss;	
They often share, and more than share the bliss:	
From every part ev’n to their inmost soul,	
They feel the trickling joys, and run with vigor to the goal.	
Stirred with the same impetuous desire,	        195
Birds, beasts, and herds, and mares, their males require:	
Because the throbbing nature in their veins	
Provokes them to assuage their kindly pains.	
The lusty leap the expecting female stands,	
By mutual heat compelled to mutual bands.	        200
Thus dogs with lolling tongues by love are tied;	
Nor shouting boys nor blows their union can divide:	
At either end they strive the link to loose;	
In vain, for stronger Venus holds the noose.	
Which never would those wretched lovers do,	        205
But that the common heats of love they know;	
The pleasure therefore must be shared in common too:	
And when the woman’s more prevailing juice	
Sucks in the man’s, the mixture will produce	
The mother’s likeness; when the man prevails,	        210
His own resemblance in the seed he seals,	
But when we see the new-begotten race	
Reflect the features of each parents’ face,	
Then of the father’s and the mother’s blood	
The justly tempered seed is understood:	        215
When both conspire, with equal ardor bent,	
From every limb the due proportion sent,	
When neither party foils, when neither foiled,	
This gives the blended features of the child.	
Sometimes the boy the grandsire’s image bears;	        220
Sometimes the more remote progenitor he shares;	
Because the genial atoms of the seed	
Lie long concealed ere they exert the breed;	
And, after sundry ages past, produce	
The tardy likeness of the latent juice.	        225
Hence, families such different figures take,	
And represent their ancestors in face, and hair, and make;	
Because of the same seed, the voice, and hair,	
And shape, and face, and other members are,	
And the same antique mold the likeness does prepare.	        230
Thus oft the father’s likeness does prevail	
In females, and the mother’s in the male;	
For, since the seed is of a double kind,	
From that where we the most resemblance find,	
We may conclude the strongest tincture sent,	        235
And that was in conception prevalent.	
  Nor can the vain decrees of powers above	
Deny production to the act of love,	
Or hinder fathers of that happy name,	
Or with a barren womb the matron shame;	        240
As many think, who stain with victims’ blood	
The mournful altars, and with incense load,	
To bless the show’ry seed with future life,	
And to impregnate the well-laboured wife.	
In vain they weary Heaven with prayer, or fly	        245
To oracles, or magic numbers try:	
For barrenness of sexes will proceed	
Either from too condensed or wat’ry seed:	
The wat’ry juice too soon dissolves away,	
And in the parts projected will not stay:	        250
The too condensed, unsouled, unwieldy mass,	
Drops short, nor carries to the destined place;	
Nor pierces to the parts, nor, tho’ injected home,	
Will mingle with the kindly moisture of the womb.	
For nuptials are alike in their success:	        255
Some men with fruitful seed some women bless;	
And from some men some women fruitful are;	
Just as their constitutions join or jar:	
And many seeming barren wives have been,	
Who after, matched with more prolific men,	        260
Have filled a family with prattling boys:	
And many, not supplied at home with joys,	
Have found a friend abroad, to ease their smart,	
And to perform the sapless husbands’ part.	
So much it does import that seed with seed	        265
Should of the kindly mixture make the breed;	
And thick with thin, and thin with thick should join,	
So to produce and propagate the line.	
Of such concernment too is drink and food,	
To incrassate, to attenuate the blood.	        270
Of like importance is the posture too,	
In which the genial feat of love we do:	
For, as the females of the four-foot kind	
Receive the leapings of their males behind;	
So the good wives, with loins uplifted high,	        275
And leaning on their hands, the fruitful stroke may try:	
For in that posture will they best conceive:	
Not when, supinely laid, they frisk and heave:	
For active motions only break the blow:	
And more of strumpets than of wives they show;	        280
When, answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow;	
Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound	
Throws off the plowshare from the furrowed ground.	
But common harlots in conjunction heave	
Because ’tis less their business to conceive	        285
Than to delight, and to provoke the deed;	
A trick which honest wives but little need.	
Now is it from the gods, or Cupid’s dart,	
That many a homely woman takes the heart,	
But wives well-humored, dutiful, and chaste,	        290
And clean, will hold their wand’ring husbands fast;	
Such are the links of love, and such a love will last.	
For what remains, long habitude, and use,	
Will kindness in domestic bands produce:	
For custom will a strong impression leave.	        295
Hard bodies, which the lightest stroke receive,	
In length of time will molder and decay,	
And stones with drops of rain are washed away.
And I lived on, to wed another:	  25
  No cause she gave me to repine;	 
And when I heard you were a mother,	 
  I did not wish the children mine.	 
My own young flock, in fair progression,	 
  Made up a pleasant Christmas row:	  30
My joy in them was past expression;	 
  But that was thirty years ago.	 
 









  HAVING, in the greener times of my youth, composed these former two hymnes in the praise of love and beautie, and finding that the same too much pleased those of like age and disposition, which, being too vehemently caried with that kind of affection, do rather sucke out poyson to their strong passion, then hony to their honest delight, I was moved by the one of you two most excellent Ladies, to call in the same. But being unable so to doe, by reason that many copies thereof were formerly scattered abroad, I resolved at least to amend, and by way of retractation to reforme them, making in stead of those two hymnes of earthly or naturall love and beautie, two others of heavenly and celestiall. The which I doe dedicate joyntly unto you two honorable sisters, as to the most excellent and rare ornaments of all true love and beautie, both in the one and the other kinde, humbly beseeching you to vouchsafe the patronage of them, and to accept this my humble service, in lieu of the great graces and honourable favours which ye dayly shew unto me, untill such time as I may by better meanes yeeld you some more notable testimonie of my thankfull mind and dutifull devotion.
  And even so I pray for your happinesse.
  Greenwich, this first of September, 1596.
Your Honors most bounden ever
            in all humble service,
Ed. Sp.    


  [The noblewomen to whom this volume is dedicated were sisters, of the great Russell family. The Lady Margaret was that Countess of Cumberland to whom Daniel, a few years later, addressed the most noble of his poems. The Countess of Warwick (whose name was Anne, not Mary) was the widow of Leicester’s brother, ‘the good earl,’ and, as such, had found mention in ‘The Ruins of Time.’
  The words of the dedication have been variously interpreted. The first pair of hymns, composed, we read, ‘in the greener times of my youth,’ (by which we are to understand, probably, the period of the Calendar and of ‘Mother Hubberd’s Tale’) having ‘too much pleased those of like age and disposition,’ were apparently, in 1596, still popular: but one of the noble sisters, disapproving of them, would have them ‘called in;’ whereupon, ‘being unable so to doe,’ the poet ‘resolved at least to amend and by way of retractation to reforme them, making, in stead of those two hymns of earthly or naturall love and beautie, two others of heavenly and celestiall.’ The difficulty is in the final clauses. Did the poet, besides composing the two later hymns, also reduce the earlier to inoffensiveness? or did he let these stand as originally written, and atone for them merely by composing their substitutes? At first, it would seem as if the second interpretation, though more in accord with the words of the letter, were impossible. For in the earlier hymns, as they are printed, there could surely be nothing to shock the most extravagant of prudes: besides, if the lady objected to them in their early form, why should the poet publish them in that form? Yet if, on the other hand, these hymns, as they are printed, be the result of expurgation, one does not see what the poet can have expurgated. Both are organically Platonic: there would seem to be no place in them, at any point, for matter even faintly licentious. Perhaps, however, it has been assumed too readily that the fault of these early hymns was of that kind. Dr. Grosart thinks that the sister who protested was the Countess of Warwick, for she is known to have inclined to Puritanism. If it was she, her protest may very well have been, not against immodesty, but against the very subject matter of these hymns, ‘earthly or naturall love and beautie.’ She may have reprobated them for sinful vanities, just as her nephew, Sidney, being on his death-bed, reprobated his own Arcadia and gave earnest orders for its destruction. In atonement for such a fault, Spenser might well issue the early hymns as they had been written, and let their vanity be foil to the earnestness of the later, composed to replace them. His repentance would then be that of the December eclogue:—
        	‘I, that whilome wont to frame my pype
Unto the shifting of the shepheards foote,
Sike follies nowe have gathered as too ripe,
And cast hem out as rotten and unsoote.
The loser lasse [Rosalind] I cast to please nomore:
One if I please [i. e. God], enough is me therefore.’
The later repentance certainly need not be taken as at all more serious than the earlier, need not be read as an example of ‘the sensitive purity of the poet’s nature.’ In composing his first two hymns he had aimed to embody in verse some of those Neo-Platonic doctrines which were then so popular in Italy, best known to Englishmen, perhaps, in the fourth book of Castiglione’s Courtier. His success had been the more brilliant in that he was first in England to occupy the field. Later, when the Countess of Warwick would have persuaded him that such vanities were unworthy of a ‘sage and serious’ poet, one can understand how he might acquiesce, and, without very real contrition for these youthful hymns, gratify her by others more in consonance with her convictions. For the Neo-Platonic modes of thought were as applicable to Christian doctrine as to theories of ‘earthly or naturall love and beautie,’ and a poet might be sincere in both uses, since neither would be understood literally and since both embodied the spirit of his most serious thought.]


AN HYMNE IN HONOUR OF LOVE

LOVE, that long since hast to thy mighty powre	
Perforce subdude my poore captived hart,	
And raging now therein with restlesse stowre,	
Doest tyrannize in everie weaker part,	
Faine would I seeke to ease my bitter smart	        5
By any service I might do to thee,	
Or ought that else might to thee pleasing bee.	
 
And now t’ asswage the force of this new flame,	
And make thee more propitious in my need,	
I meane to sing the praises of thy name,	        10
And thy victorious conquests to areed;	
By which thou madest many harts to bleed	
Of mighty victors, with wyde wounds embrewed,	
And by thy cruell darts to thee subdewed.	
 
Onely I feare my wits, enfeebled late	        15
Through the sharpe sorrowes which thou hast me bred,	
Should faint, and words should faile me to relate	
The wondrous triumphs of thy great godhed.	
But, if thou wouldst vouchsafe to overspred	
Me with the shadow of thy gentle wing,	        20
I should enabled be thy actes to sing.	
 
Come then, O come, thou mightie God of Love,	
Out of thy silver bowres and secret blisse,	
Where thou doest sit in Venus lap above,	
Bathing thy wings in her ambrosiall kisse,	        25
That sweeter farre then any nectar is;	
Come softly, and my feeble breast inspire	
With gentle furie, kindled of thy fire.	
 
And ye, sweet Muses, which have often proved	
The piercing points of his avengefull darts,	        30
And ye, faire nimphs, which oftentimes have loved	
The cruell worker of your kindly smarts,	
Prepare your selves, and open wide your harts,	
For to receive the triumph of your glorie,	
That made you merie oft, when ye were sorie.	        35
 
And ye, faire blossomes of youths wanton breed,	
Which in the conquests of your beautie bost,	
Wherewith your lovers feeble eyes you feed,	
But sterve their harts, that needeth nourture most,	
Prepare your selves to march amongst his host,	        40
And all the way this sacred hymne do sing,	
Made in the honor of your soveraigne king.	
 
GREAT God of might, that reignest in the mynd,	
And all the bodie to thy hest doest frame,	
Victor of gods, subduer of mankynd,	        45
That doest the lions and fell tigers tame,	
Making their cruell rage thy scornefull game,	
And in their roring taking great delight,	
Who can expresse the glorie of thy might?	
 
Or who alive can perfectly declare	        50
The wondrous cradle of thine infancie,	
When thy great mother Venus first thee bare,	
Begot of Plentie and of Penurie,	
Though elder then thine owne nativitie;	
And yet a chyld, renewing still thy yeares,	        55
And yet the eldest of the heavenly peares?	
 
For ere this worlds still moving mightie masse	
Out of great Chaos ugly prison crept,	
In which his goodly face long hidden was	
From heavens view, and in deepe darknesse kept,	        60
Love, that had now long time securely slept	
In Venus lap, unarmed then and naked,	
Gan reare his head, by Clotho being waked.	
 
And taking to him wings of his owne heate,	
Kindled at first from heavens life-giving fyre,	        65
He gan to move out of his idle seate,	
Weakely at first, but after with desyre	
Lifted aloft, he gan to mount up hyre,	
And like fresh eagle, make his hardie flight	
Through all that great wide wast, yet wanting light.	        70
 
Yet wanting light to guide his wandring way,	
His owne faire mother, for all creatures sake,	
Did lend him light from her owne goodly ray:	
Then through the world his way he gan to take,	
The world, that was not till he did it make,	        75
Whose sundrie parts he from them selves did sever,	
The which before had lyen confused ever.	
 
The earth, the ayre, the water, and the fyre,	
Then gan to raunge them selves in huge array,	
And with contrary forces to conspyre	        80
Each against other, by all meanes they may,	
Threatning their owne confusion and decay:	
Ayre hated earth, and water hated fyre,	
Till Love relented their rebellious yre.	
 
He then them tooke, and tempering goodly well	        85
Their contrary dislikes with loved meanes,	
Did place them all in order, and compell	
To keepe them selves within their sundrie raines,	
Together linkt with adamantine chaines;	
Yet so as that in every living wight	        90
They mixe themselves, and shew their kindly might.	
 
So ever since they firmely have remained,	
And duly well observed his beheast;	
Through which now all these things that are contained	
Within this goodly cope, both most and least,	        95
Their being have, and dayly are increast	
Through secret sparks of his infused fyre,	
Which in the barraine cold he doth inspyre.	
 
Thereby they all do live, and moved are	
To multiply the likenesse of their kynd,	        100
Whilest they seeke onely, without further care,	
To quench the flame which they in burning fynd:	
But man, that breathes a more immortall mynd,	
Not for lusts sake, but for eternitie,	
Seekes to enlarge his lasting progenie.	        105
 
For having yet in his deducted spright	
Some sparks remaining of that heavenly fyre,	
He is enlumind with that goodly light,	
Unto like goodly semblant to aspyre:	
Therefore in choice of love, he doth desyre	        110
That seemes on earth most heavenly, to embrace;	
That same is Beautie, borne of heavenly race.	
 
For sure, of all that in this mortall frame	
Contained is, nought more divine doth seeme,	
Or that resembleth more th’ immortall flame	        115
Of heavenly light, then Beauties glorious beame.	
What wonder then, if with such rage extreme	
Fraile men, whose eyes seek heavenly things to see,	
At sight thereof so much enravisht bee?	
 
Which well perceiving, that imperious boy	        120
Doth therwith tip his sharp empoisned darts;	
Which, glancing through the eyes with countenance coy,	
Rest not till they have pierst the trembling harts,	
And kindled flame in all their inner parts,	
Which suckes the blood, and drinketh up the lyfe	        125
Of carefull wretches with consuming griefe.	
 
Thenceforth they playne, and make ful piteous mone	
Unto the author of their balefull bane;	
The daies they waste, the nights they grieve and grone,	
Their lives they loath, and heavens light disdaine;	        130
No light but that whose lampe doth yet remaine	
Fresh burning in the image of their eye,	
They deigne to see, and seeing it still dye.	
 
The whylst thou, tyrant Love, doest laugh and scorne	
At their complaints, making their paine thy play;	        135
Whylest they lye languishing like thrals forlorne,	
The whyles thou doest triumph in their decay,	
And otherwhyles, their dying to delay,	
Thou doest emmarble the proud hart of her,	
Whose love before their life they doe prefer.	        140
 
So hast thou often done (ay me the more!)	
To me thy vassall, whose yet bleeding hart	
With thousand wounds thou mangled hast so sore	
That whole remaines scarse any little part;	
Yet to augment the anguish of my smart,	        145
Thou hast enfrosen her disdainefull brest,	
That no one drop of pitie there doth rest.	
 
Why then do I this honor unto thee,	
Thus to ennoble thy victorious name,	
Since thou doest shew no favour unto mee,	        150
Ne once move ruth in that rebellious dame,	
Somewhat to slacke the rigour of my flame?	
Certes small glory doest thou winne hereby,	
To let her live thus free, and me to dy.	
 
But if thou be indeede, as men thee call,	        155
The worlds great parent, the most kind preserver	
Of living wights, the soveraine lord of all,	
How falles it then that with thy furious fervour	
Thou doest afflict as well the not deserver,	
As him that doeth thy lovely heasts despize,	        160
And on thy subjects most doest tyrannize?	
 
Yet herein eke thy glory seemeth more,	
By so hard handling those which best thee serve,	
That ere thou doest them unto grace restore,	
Thou mayest well trie if they will ever swerve,	        165
And mayest them make it better to deserve,	
And having got it, may it more esteeme;	
For things hard gotten men more dearely deeme.	
 
So hard those heavenly beauties be enfyred,	
As things divine least passions doe impresse,	        170
The more of stedfast mynds to be admyred,	
The more they stayed be on stedfastnesse:	
But baseborne mynds such lamps regard the lesse,	
Which at first blowing take not hastie fyre;	
Such fancies feele no love, but loose desyre.	        175
 
For Love is lord of truth and loialtie,	
Lifting himselfe out of the lowly dust	
On golden plumes up to the purest skie,	
Above the reach of loathly sinfull lust,	
Whose base affect, through cowardly distrust	        180
Of his weake wings, dare not to heaven fly,	
But like a moldwarpe in the earth doth ly.	
 
His dunghill thoughts, which do themselves enure	
To dirtie drosse, no higher dare aspyre,	
Ne can his feeble earthly eyes endure	        185
The flaming light of that celestiall fyre,	
Which kindleth love in generous desyre,	
And makes him mount above the native might	
Of heavie earth, up to the heavens hight.	
 
Such is the powre of that sweet passion,	        190
That it all sordid basenesse doth expell,	
And the refyned mynd doth newly fashion	
Unto a fairer forme, which now doth dwell	
In his high thought, that would it selfe excell;	
Which he beholding still with constant sight,	        195
Admires the mirrour of so heavenly light.	
 
Whose image printing in his deepest wit,	
He thereon feeds his hungrie fantasy,	
Still full, yet never satisfyde with it;	
Like Tantale, that in store doth sterved ly,	        200
So doth he pine in most satiety;	
For nought may quench his infinite desyre,	
Once kindled through that first conceived fyre.	
 
Thereon his mynd affixed wholly is,	
Ne thinks on ought, but how it to attaine;	        205
His care, his joy, his hope is all on this,	
That seemes in it all blisses to containe,	
In sight whereof all other blisse seemes vaine.	
Thrise happie man, might he the same possesse,	
He faines himselfe, and doth his fortune blesse.	        210
 
And though he do not win his wish to end,	
Yet thus farre happie he him selfe doth weene,	
That heavens such happie grace did to him lend,	
As thing on earth so heavenly to have seene,	
His harts enshrined saint, his heavens queene,	        215
Fairer then fairest, in his fayning eye,	
Whose sole aspect he counts felicitye.	
 
Then forth he casts in his unquiet thought,	
What he may do, her favour to obtaine;	
What brave exploit, what perill hardly wrought,	        220
What puissant conquest, what adventurous paine,	
May please her best, and grace unto him gaine:	
He dreads no danger, nor misfortune feares;	
His faith, his fortune, in his breast he beares.	
 
Thou art his god, thou art his mightie guyde,	        225
Thou, being blind, letst him not see his feares,	
But cariest him to that which he hath eyde,	
Through seas, through flames, through thousand swords and speares:	
Ne ought so strong that may his force withstand,	
With which thou armest his resistlesse hand.	        230
 
Witnesse Leander in the Euxine waves,	
And stout Æneas in the Trojane fyre,	
Achilles preassing through the Phrygian glaives,	
And Orpheus daring to provoke the yre	
Of damned fiends, to get his love retyre:	        235
For both through heaven and hell thou makest way,	
To win them worship which to thee obay.	
 
And if by all these perils and these paynes	
He may but purchase lyking in her eye,	
What heavens of joy then to himselfe he faynes!	        240
Eftsoones he wypes quite out of memory	
What ever ill before he did aby;	
Had it bene death, yet would he die againe,	
To live thus happie as her grace to gaine.	
 
Yet when he hath found favour to his will,	        245
He nathemore can so contented rest,	
But forceth further on, and striveth still	
T’ approch more neare, till in her inmost brest	
He may embosomd bee, and loved best;	
And yet not best, but to be lov’d alone;	        250
For love can not endure a paragone.	
 
The feare whereof, O how doth it torment	
His troubled mynd with more then hellish paine!	
And to his fayning fansie represent	
Sights never seene, and thousand shadowes vaine,	        255
To breake his sleepe and waste his ydle braine;	
Thou that hast never lov’d canst not beleeve	
Least part of th’ evils which poore lovers greeve.	
 
The gnawing envie, the hart-fretting feare,	
The vaine surmizes, the distrustfull showes,	        260
The false reports that flying tales doe beare,	
The doubts, the daungers, the delayes, the woes,	
The fayned friends, the unassured foes,	
With thousands more then any tongue can tell,	
Doe make a lovers life a wretches hell.	        265
 
Yet is there one more cursed then they all,	
That cancker worme, that monster Gelosie,	
Which eates the hart, and feedes upon the gall,	
Turning all loves delight to miserie,	
Through feare of loosing his felicitie.	        270
Ah, gods! that ever ye that monster placed	
In gentle love, that all his joyes defaced!	
 
By these, O Love, thou doest thy entrance make	
Unto thy heaven, and doest the more endeere	
Thy pleasures unto those which them partake,	        275
As after stormes, when clouds begin to cleare,	
The sunne more bright and glorious doth appeare;	
So thou thy folke, through paines of Purgatorie,	
Dost beare unto thy blisse, and heavens glorie.	
 
O TALK not to me of a name great in story;	 
The days of our youth are the days of our glory;	 
And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty	 
Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.	 
  
What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?	         5
'Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:	 
Then away with all such from the head that is hoary—	 
What care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?	 
  
O Fame! if I e'er took delight in thy praises,	 
'Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,	  10
Than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover	 
She thought that I was not unworthy to love her.	 
  
There chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;	 
Her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;	 
When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,	  15
I knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.	 
 
There thou them placest in a paradize	        280
Of all delight and joyous happie rest,	
Where they doe feede on nectar heavenly wize,	
With Hercules and Hebe, and the rest	
Of Venus dearlings, through her bountie blest,	
And lie like gods in yvorie beds arayd,	        285
With rose and lillies over them displayd.	
  
From “Paradise Lost,” Book VIII.

MINE eyes he closed, but open left the cell	
Of fancy, my internal sight, by which	
Abstract, as in a trance, methought I saw,	
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape	
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;	        5
Who, stooping, opened my left side, and took	
From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,	
And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,	
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:	
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;	        10
Under his forming hands a creature grew,	
Manlike, but different sex, so lovely fair,	
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now	
Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained,	
And in her looks, which from that time infused	        15
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,	
And into all things from her air inspired	
The spirit of love and amorous delight.	
She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked	
To find her, or forever to deplore	        20
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:	
When out of hope, behold her, not far off,	
Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned	
With what all earth or Heaven could bestow	
To make her amiable. On she came,	        25
Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,	
And guided by his voice, nor uninformed	
Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites:	
Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,	
In every gesture dignity and love.	        30
I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud:	
  “This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled	
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,	
Giver of all things fair, but fairest this	
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see	        35
Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself	
Before me; Woman is her name, of man	
Extracted: for this cause he shall forego	
Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;	
And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.”	        40
  She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,	
Yet innocence and virgin modesty,	
Her virtue and the conscience of her worth,	
That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,	
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired,	        45
The more desirable; or, to say all,	
Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,	
Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned;	
I followed her; she what was honor knew,	
And with obsequious majesty approved	        50
My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower	
I led her blushing like the morn: all Heaven,	
And happy constellations on that hour	
Shed their selectest influence; the earth	
Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;	        55
Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs	
Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings	
Flung rose, flung odors from the spicy shrub,	
Disporting, till the amorous bird of night	
Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening star	        60
On his hill-top, to light the bridal lamp.
*        *        *        *        *
                        When I approach	
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems,	
And in herself complete, so well to know	
Her own, that what she wills to do or say	
Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best;	        65
All higher knowledge in her presence falls	
Degraded, wisdom in discourse with her	
Loses discountenanced, and like folly shows;	
Authority and reason on her wait,	
As one intended first, not after made	        70
Occasionally; and, to consummate all,	
Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat	
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe	
About her, as a guard angelic placed,
*        *        *        *        *
Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught
*        *        *        *        *
        75
So much delights me, as those graceful acts,	
Those thousand decencies that daily flow	
From all her words and actions, mixed with love	
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned	
Union of mind, or in us both one soul;	        80
Harmony to behold in wedded pair	
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.	

 
I KNOW my Love by his way of walking,	
And I know my love by his way of talking,	
And I know my love dressed in a suit of blue,	
And if my Love leaves me, what will I do?	
  And still she cried, “I love him the best,	        5
  And a troubled mind, sure, can know no rest,”	
  And still she cried, “Bonny boys are few,	
  And if my Love leaves me, what will I do?”	
 
There is a dance house in Mar’dyke,	
And there my true love goes every night;	        10
He takes a strange one upon his knee,	
And don’t you think, now, that vexes me?	
  And still she cried, “I love him the best,	
  And a troubled mind, sure, can know no rest,”	
  And still she cried, “Bonny boys are few,	        15
  And if my Love leaves me, what will I do?”	
  
OH! the days are gone, when Beauty bright	
        My heart’s chain wove;	
When my dream of life, from morn till night,	
        Was love, still love.	
        New hope may bloom,	        5
        And days may come	
    Of milder, calmer beam,	
But there’s nothing half so sweet in life	
    As love’s young dream:	
No, there’s nothing half so sweet in life	        10
    As love’s young dream.	
  
I
LOVE is enough: though the World be a-waning,	
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,	
  Though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover	
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,	
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,	        5
  And this day draw a veil over all deeds pass’d over,	
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter;	
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter	
  These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.	
 
II
LOVE is enough: ho ye who seek saving,	        10
  Go no further; come hither! there have been who have found it,	
And these know the House of Fulfilment of Craving;	
  These know the Cup with the roses around it;	
  These know the World’s wound and the balm that hath bound it:	
Cry out, the World heedeth not, ‘Love, lead us home!’	        15
 
He leadeth, He hearkeneth, He cometh to you-ward;	
  Set your faces as steel to the fears that assemble	
Round his goad for the faint, and his scourge for the froward:	
  Lo his lips, how with tales of last kisses they tremble!	
  Lo his eyes of all sorrow that may not dissemble!	        20
Cry out, for he heedeth, ‘O Love, lead us home!’	
  
NOW 1 what is Love, I pray thee, tell?	
It is that fountain and that well	
Where pleasure and repentance dwell;	
It is perhaps the sauncing bell 2	
That tolls all into heaven or hell:	        5
And this is Love, as I hear tell.	
 
Yet what is Love, I prithee, say?	
It is a work on holiday,	
It is December matched with May,	
When lusty bloods in fresh array	        10
Hear ten months after of the play:	
And this is Love, as I hear say.	
 
She

ONLY to be twin elements of joy	
In this extravagance of Being, Love,	
Were our divided natures shaped in twain;	
And to this hour the whole world must consent.	
Is it not very marvellous, our lives	        5
Can only come to this out of a long	
Strange sundering, with the years of the world between us?	
 
He

  Shall life do more than God? for hath not God	
Striven with himself, when into known delight	
His unaccomplisht joy he would put forth,—	       10
This mystery of a world sign of his striving?	
Else wherefore this, a thing to break the mind	
With labouring in the wonder of it, that here	
Being—the world and we—is suffered to be!—	
But, lying on thy breast one notable day,	       15
Sudden exceeding agony of love	
Made my mind a trance of infinite knowledge.	
I was not: yet I saw the will of God	
As light unfashion’d, unendurable flame,	
Interminable, not to be supposed;	       20
And there was no more creature except light,—	
The dreadful burning of the lonely God’s	
Unutter’d joy. And then, past telling, came	
Shuddering and division in the light:	
Therein, like trembling, was desire to know	       25
Its own perfect beauty; and it became	
A cloven fire, a double flaming, each	
Adorable to each; against itself	
Waging a burning love, which was the world;—	
A moment satisfied in that love-strife	       30
I knew the world!—And when I fell from there,	
Then knew I also what this life would do	
In being twin,—in being man and woman!	
For it would do even as its endless Master,	
Making the world, had done; yea, with itself	       35
Would strive, and for the strife would into sex	
Be cloven, double burning, made thereby	
Desirable to itself. Contrivèd joy	
Is sex in life; and by no other thing	
Than by a perfect sundering, could life	       40
Change the dark stream of unappointed joy	
To perfect praise of itself, the glee that loves	
And worships its own Being. This is ours!	
Yet only for that we have been so long	
Sundered desire: thence is our life all praise.—	       45
But we, well knowing by our strength of joy	
There is no sundering more, how far we love	
From those sad lives that know a half-love only,	
Alone thereby knowing themselves for ever	
Sealed in division of love, and therefore made	       50
To pour their strength always into their love’s	
Fierceness, as green wood bleeds its hissing sap	
Into red heat of a fire! Not so do we:	
The cloven anger, life, hath left to wage	
Its flame against itself, here turned to one	       55
Self-adoration.—Ah, what comes of this?	
The joy falters a moment, with closed wings	
Wearying in its upward journey, ere	
Again it goes on high, bearing its song,	
Its delight breathing and its vigour beating	       60
The highest height of the air above the world.	
 
She

  What hast thou done to me!—I would have soul,	
Before I knew thee, Love, a captive held	
By flesh. Now, inly delighted with desire,	
My body knows itself to be nought else	       65
But thy heart’s worship of me; and my soul	
Therein is sunlight held by warm gold air.	
Nay, all my body is become a song	
Upon the breath of spirit, a love-song.	
 
He

  And mine is all like one rapt faculty,	       70
As it were listening to the love in thee,	
My whole mortality trembling to take	
Thy body like heard singing of thy spirit.	
 
She

  Surely by this, Beloved, we must know	
Our love is perfect here,—that not as holds	       75
The common dullard thought, we are things lost	
In an amazement that is all unware;	
But wonderfully knowing what we are!	
Lo, now that body is the song whereof	
Spirit is mood, knoweth not our delight?	       80
Knoweth not beautifully now our love,	
That Life, here to this festival bid come	
Clad in his splendour of worldly day and night,	
Filled and empower’d by heavenly lust, is all	
The glad imagination of the Spirit?	       85
 
He

  Were it not so, Love could not be at all:	
Nought could be, but a yearning to fulfil	
Desire of beauty, by vain reaching forth	
Of sense to hold and understand the vision	
Made by impassion’d body,—vision of thee!	       90
But music mixt with music are, in love,	
Bodily senses; and as flame hath light,	
Spirit this nature hath imagined round it,	
No way concealed therein, when love comes near,	
Nor in the perfect wedding of desires	       95
Suffering any hindrance.	
 
She

  Ah, but now,	
Now am I given love’s eternal secret!	
Yea, thou and I who speak, are but the joy	
Of our for ever mated spirits; but now	      100
The wisdom of my gladness even through Spirit	
Looks, divinely elate. Who hath for joy	
Our Spirits? Who hath imagined them	
Round him in fashion’d radiance of desire,	
As into light of these exulting bodies	      105
Flaming Spirit is uttered?	
 
He
ALL thoughts, all passions, all delights,	 
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,	 
All are but ministers of Love,	 
    And feed his sacred flame.	 
 
Oft in my waking dreams do I	         5
Live o'er again that happy hour,	 
When midway on the mount I lay,	 
    Beside the ruin'd tower.	 
 
The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene,	 
Had blended with the lights of eve;	  10
And she was there, my hope, my joy,	 
    My own dear Genevieve!	 
 
She lean'd against the armèd man,	 
The statue of the armèd Knight;	 
She stood and listen'd to my lay,	  15
    Amid the lingering light.	 
 
Few sorrows hath she of her own,	 
My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!	 
She loves me best whene'er I sing	 
    The songs that make her grieve.	  20
 
I play'd a soft and doleful air;	 
I sang an old and moving story—	 
An old rude song, that suited well	 
    That ruin wild and hoary.	 
 
She listen'd with a flitting blush,	  25
With downcast eyes and modest grace;	 
For well she knew I could not choose	 
    But gaze upon her face.	 
 
I told her of the Knight that wore	 
Upon his shield a burning brand;	  30
And that for ten long years he woo'd	 
    The Lady of the Land.	 
 
I told her how he pined: and ah!	 
The deep, the low, the pleading tone	 
With which I sang another's love,	  35
    Interpreted my own.	 
 
She listen'd with a flitting blush,	 
With downcast eyes, and modest grace;	 
And she forgave me, that I gazed	 
    Too fondly on her face!	  40
 
But when I told the cruel scorn	 
That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,	 
And that he cross'd the mountain-woods,	 
    Nor rested day nor night;	 
 
That sometimes from the savage den,	  45
And sometimes from the darksome shade,	 
And sometimes starting up at once	 
    In green and sunny glade—	 
 
There came and look'd him in the face	 
An angel beautiful and bright;	  50
And that he knew it was a Fiend,	 
    This miserable Knight!	 
 
And that, unknowing what he did,	 
He leap'd amid a murderous band,	 
And saved from outrage worse than death	  55
    The Lady of the Land;—	 
 
And how she wept and clasp'd his knees;	 
And how she tended him in vain—	 
And ever strove to expiate	 
    The scorn that crazed his brain;—	  60
 
And that she nursed him in a cave;	 
And how his madness went away,	 
When on the yellow forest leaves	 
    A dying man he lay;—	 
 
His dying words—but when I reach'd	  65
That tenderest strain of all the ditty,	 
My faltering voice and pausing harp	 
    Disturb'd her soul with pity!	 
 
All impulses of soul and sense	 
Had thrill'd my guileless Genevieve;	  70
The music and the doleful tale,	 
    The rich and balmy eve;	 
 Melibœus.
SHEPHERD, what’s love, I pray thee tell?	
Fau.  It is that fountain and that well	
Where pleasure and repentance dwell;	
It is perhaps that sauncing bell	
  That tolls all into heaven or hell;	        5
  And this is love as I heard tell.	
 
Meli.  Yet what is love, I prithee say?	
Fau.  It is a work on holiday;	
It is December matched with May,	
When lusty bloods, in fresh array,	        10
  Hear ten months after of the play;	
  And this is love as I hear say.	
  
LET it go on; let the love of this hour be poured out till all the answers are made, the last dollar spent and the last blood gone.	
  
Time runs with an ax and a hammer, time slides down the hallways with a pass-key and a master-key, and time gets by, time wins.	
  
Let the love of this hour go on; let all the oaths and children and people of this love be clean as a washed stone under a waterfall in the sun.	
  
Time is a young man with ballplayer legs, time runs a winning race against life and the clocks, time tickles with rust and spots.	
  
Let love go on; the heartbeats are measured out with a measuring glass, so many apiece to gamble with, to use and spend and reckon; let love go on.	        5


 
FROM the Desert I come to thee,	
  On a stallion shod with fire;	
And the winds are left behind	
  In the speed of my desire.	
Under thy window I stand,	        5
  And the midnight hears my cry:	
I love thee, I love but thee!	
  With a love that shall not die	
    Till the sun grows cold,	
    And the stars are old,	        10
    And the leaves of the Judgment	
        Book unfold!	
  
WHOEVER loves, if he do not propose	
The right true end of love, he’s one that goes	
To sea for nothing but to make him sick.	
Love is a bear-whelp born; if we o’er-lick	
Our love, and force it new strange shapes 1 to take,	        5
We err, and of a lump a monster make.	
Were not a calf a monster, that were grown	
Faced like a man, though better than his own?	
Perfection is in unity; prefer	
One woman first, and then one thing in her.	        10
I, when I value gold, may think upon	
The ductileness, the application,	
The wholesomeness, the ingenuity,	
From rust, from soil, from fire ever free;	
But if I love it, ’tis because ’tis made	        15
By our new nature, use, the soul of trade.	
  All this in women we might think upon,	
—If women had them—and yet love but one.	
Can men more injure women than to say	
They love them for that, by which they’re not they?	        20
Makes virtue woman? must I cool my blood	
Till I both be, and find one wise and good?	
May barren angels love so. But if we	
Make love to woman, virtue is not she,	
As beauty is not, nor wealth. 2 He that strays thus	        25
From her to hers is more adulterous	
Than if he took her maid. Search every sphere	
And firmament, our Cupid is not there.	
He’s an infernal God, and underground	
With Pluto dwells, where gold and fire abound.	        30
Men to such gods their sacrificing coals	
Did not on altars lay, but pits and holes.	
Although we see celestial bodies move	
Above the earth, the earth we till and love.	
So we her airs contemplate, words and heart,	        35
And virtues, but we love the centric part.	
  Nor is the soul more worthy, or more fit	
For love, than this, as infinite as it.	
But in attaining this desired place	
How much they err, that set out at the face?	        40
The hair a forest 3 is of ambushes,	
Of springes, snares, fetters, and manacles;	
The brow becalms us when ’tis smooth and plain,	
And when ’tis wrinkled, shipwrecks us again;	
Smooth, ’tis a paradise, where we would have	        45
Immortal stay, but wrinkled ’tis a grave.	
The nose, like to the first meridian, 4 runs	
Not ’twixt an east and west, but ’twixt two suns;	
It leaves a cheek, a rosy hemisphere,	
On either side, and then directs us where	        50
Upon the islands fortunate we fall,	
Not faint Canaries, but ambrosial,	
Her swelling lips, to which when we are come, 5	
We anchor there, and think ourselves at home,	
For they seem all; there Siren’s songs and there	        55
Wise Delphic oracles do fill the ear.	
There, 6 in a creek where chosen pearls do swell,	
The remora, her cleaving tongue, doth dwell.	
These and the glorious promontory, her chin,	
O’erpast, and the straight Hellespont 7 between	        60
The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts,	
Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests,	
Succeeds a boundless sea, but yet thine eye	
Some island moles may scattered there descry;	
And sailing towards her India, in that way	        65
Shall at her fair Atlantic navel stay.	
Though there the current be the pilot made,	
Yet, ere thou be where thou shouldst be embay’d,	
Thou shalt upon another forest set,	
Where many shipwreck, and no further get.	        70
When thou art there, consider what this chase	
Misspent by thy beginning at the face.	
  Rather set out below; practise thy art;	
Some symmetry the foot hath with that part	
Which thou dost seek, and is thy map for that,	        75
Lovely enough to stop, but not stay at.	
Least subject to disguise and change it is;	
Men say the devil never can change his;	
It is the emblem that hath figured	
Firmness; ’tis the first part that comes to bed.	        80
Civility we see refined; the kiss,	
Which at the face began, transplanted is,	
Since to the hand, since to the imperial knee,	
Now at the papal foot delights to be.	
If kings think that the nearer way, and do	        85
Rise from the foot, lovers may do so too;	
For, as free spheres move faster far than can	
Birds, whom the air resists, so may that man	
Which goes this empty and ethereal way,	
Than if at beauty’s elements 8 he stay.	        90
Rich Nature in women wisely made	
Two purses, and their mouths aversely laid.	
They then, which to the lower tribute owe,	
That way which that exchequer looks must go;	
He which doth not, his error is as great,	        95
As who by clyster gives the stomach meat.	

 
LOVE, a child, is ever crying;	
Please him, and he straight is flying;	
Give him, he the more is craving,	
Never satisfied with having.	
 
His desires have no measure;	        5
Endless folly is his treasure;	
What he promiseth he breaketh;	
Trust not one word that he speaketh.	
 
He vows nothing but false matter;	
And to cozen you will flatter;	        10
Let him gain the hand, he’ll leave you	
And still glory to deceive you.	
 
He will triumph in your wailing;	
And yet cause be of your failing:	
These his virtues are, and slighter	        15
Are his gifts, his favours lighter.	
 
Feathers are as firm in staying;	
Wolves no fiercer in their preying;	
As a child then, leave him crying;	
Nor seek him so given to flying.	        20
  
LOVE in a hut, with water and a crust,	
Is—Love, forgive us!—cinders, ashes, dust;	
Love in a palace is perhaps at last	
More grievous torment than a hermit’s fast:—	
That is a doubtful tale from faery land,	        5
Hard for the non-elect to understand.	
Had Lycius liv’d to hand his story down,	
He might have given the moral a fresh frown,	
Or clench’d it quite: but too short was their bliss	
To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.	        10
Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare,	
Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,	
Hover’d and buzz’d his wings, with fearful roar,	
Above the lintel of their chamber door,	
And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.	        15
 
  For all this came a ruin: side by side	
They were enthroned, in the even tide,	
Upon a couch, near to a curtaining	
Whose airy texture, from a golden string,	
Floated into the room, and let appear	        20
Unveil’d the summer heaven, blue and clear,	
Betwixt two marble shafts:—there they reposed,	
Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,	
Saving a tythe which love still open kept,	
That they might see each other while they almost slept;	        25
When from the slope side of a suburb hill,	
Deafening the swallow’s twitter, came a thrill	
Of trumpets—Lycius started—the sounds fled,	
But left a thought, a buzzing in his head.	
For the first time, since first he harbour’d in	        30
That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,	
His spirit pass’d beyond its golden bourn	
Into the noisy world almost forsworn.	
The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,	
Saw this with pain, so arguing a want	        35
Of something more, more than her empery	
Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh	
Because he mused beyond her, knowing well	
That but a moment’s thought is passion’s passing bell.	
“Why do you sigh, fair creature?” whisper’d he:	        40
“Why do you think?” return’d she tenderly:	
“You have deserted me;—where am I now?	
“Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow:	
“No, no, you have dismiss’d me; and I go	
“From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so.”	        45
He answer’d, bending to her open eyes,	
Where he was mirror’d small in paradise,	
“My silver planet, both of eve and morn!	
“Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,	
“While I am striving how to fill my heart	        50
“With deeper crimson, and a double smart?	
“How to entangle, trammel up and snare	
“Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there	
“Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?	
“Ay, a sweet kiss—you see your mighty woes.	        55
“My thoughts! shall I unveil them? Listen then!	
“What mortal hath a prize, that other men	
“May be confounded and abash’d withal,	
“But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,	
“And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice	        60
“Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth’s voice.	
“Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,	
“While through the thronged streets your bridal car	
“Wheels round its dazzling spokes.”—The lady’s cheek	
Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,	        65
Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain	
Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain	
Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,	
To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,	
Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim	        70
Her wild and timid nature to his aim:	
Besides, for all his love, in self despite,	
Against his better self, he took delight	
Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.	
His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue	        75
Fierce and sanguineous as ’twas possible	
In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.	
Fine was the mitigated fury, like	
Apollo’s presence when in act to strike	
The serpent—Ha, the serpent! certes, she	        80
Was none. She burnt, she lov’d the tyranny,	
And, all subdued, consented to the hour	
When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.	
Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,	
“Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,	        85
“I have not ask’d it, ever thinking thee	
“Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,	
“As still I do. Hast any mortal name,	
“Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?	
“Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,	        90
“To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?”	
“I have no friends,” said Lamia, “no, not one;	
“My presence in wide Corinth hardly known:	
“My parents’ bones are in their dusty urns	
“Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,	        95
“Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,	
“And I neglect the holy rite for thee.	
“Even as you list invite your many guests;	
“But if, as now it seems, your vision rests	
“With any pleasure on me, do not bid	        100
“Old Apollonius—from him keep me hid.”	
Lycius, perplex’d at words so blind and blank,	
Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,	
Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade	
Of deep sleep in a moment was betray’d.	        105
 
  It was the custom then to bring away	
The bride from home at blushing shut of day,	
Veil’d, in a chariot, heralded along	
By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,	
With other pageants: but this fair unknown	        110
Had not a friend. So being left alone,	
(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)	
And knowing surely she could never win	
His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,	
She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress	        115
The misery in fit magnificence.	
She did so, but ’tis doubtful how and whence	
Came, and who were her subtle servitors.	
About the halls, and to and from the doors,	
There was a noise of wings, till in short space	        120
The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.	
A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone	
Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan	
Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.	
Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade	        125
Of palm and plantain, met from either side,	
High in the midst, in honour of the bride:	
Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,	
From either side their stems branch’d one to one	
All down the aisled place; and beneath all	        130
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.	
So canopied, lay an untasted feast	
Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,	
Silently paced about, and as she went,	
In pale contented sort of discontent,	        135
Mission’d her viewless servants to enrich	
The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.	
Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,	
Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst	
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,	        140
And with the larger wove in small intricacies.	
Approving all, she faded at self-will,	
And shut the chamber up, close, hush’d and still,	
Complete and ready for the revels rude,	
When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.	        145
 
  The day appear’d, and all the gossip rout.	
O senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout	
The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister’d hours,	
And show to common eyes these secret bowers?	
The herd approach’d; each guest, with busy brain,	        150
Arriving at the portal, gaz’d amain,	
And enter’d marveling: for they knew the street,	
Remember’d it from childhood all complete	
Without a gap, yet ne’er before had seen	
That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;	        155
So in they hurried all, maz’d, curious and keen:	
Save one, who look’d thereon with eye severe,	
And with calm-planted steps walk’d in austere;	
’Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh’d,	
As though some knotty problem, that had daft	        160
His patient thought, had now begun to thaw,	
And solve and melt:—’twas just as he foresaw.	
 
  He met within the murmurous vestibule	
His young disciple. “’Tis no common rule,	
“Lycius,” said he, “for uninvited guest	        165
“To force himself upon you, and infest	
“With an unbidden presence the bright throng	
“Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,	
“And you forgive me.” Lycius blush’d, and led	
The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;	        170
With reconciling words and courteous mien	
Turning into sweet milk the sophist’s spleen.	
 
  Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,	
Fill’d with pervading brilliance and perfume:	
Before each lucid pannel fuming stood	        175
A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,	
Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,	
Whose slender feet wide-swerv’d upon the soft	
Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke	
From fifty censers their light voyage took	        180
To the high roof, still mimick’d as they rose	
Along the mirror’d walls by twin-clouds odorous.	
Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,	
High as the level of a man’s breast rear’d	
On libbard’s paws, upheld the heavy gold	        185
Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told	
Of Ceres’ horn, and, in huge vessels, wine	
Came from the gloomy tun with merry shine.	
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,	
Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.	        190
 
  When in an antichamber every guest	
Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press’d,	
By minist’ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,	
And fragrant oils with ceremony meet	
Pour’d on his hair, they all mov’d to the feast	        195
In white robes, and themselves in order placed	
Around the silken couches, wondering	
Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.	
 
  Soft went the music the soft air along,	
While fluent Greek a vowel’d undersong	        200
Kept up among the guests discoursing low	
At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;	
But when the happy vintage touch’d their brains,	
Louder they talk, and louder come the strains	
Of powerful instruments:—the gorgeous dyes,	        205
The space, the splendour of the draperies,	
The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,	
Beautiful slaves, and Lamia’s self, appear,	
Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,	
And every soul from human trammels freed,	        210
No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,	
Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.	
Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height;	
Flush’d were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright:	
Garlands of every green, and every scent	        215
From vales deflower’d, or forest-trees branch rent,	
In baskets of bright osier’d gold were brought	
High as the handles heap’d, to suit the thought	
Of every guest; that each, as he did please,	
Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow’d at his ease.	        220
 
  What wreath for Lamia? What for Lycius?	
What for the sage, old Apollonius?	
Upon her aching forehead be there hung	
The leaves of willow and of adder’s tongue;	
And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him	        225
The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim	
Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage,	
Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage	
War on his temples. Do not all charms fly	
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?	        230
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:	
We know her woof, her texture; she is given	
In the dull catalogue of common things.	
Philosophy will clip an Angel’s wings,	
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,	        235
Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine—	
Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made	
The tender-person’d Lamia melt into a shade.	
 
  By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,	
Scarce saw in all the room another face,	        240
Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took	
Full brimm’d, and opposite sent forth a look	
’Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance	
From his old teacher’s wrinkled countenance,	
And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher	        245
Had fix’d his eye, without a twinkle or stir	
Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,	
Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.	
Lycius then press’d her hand, with devout touch,	
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch:	        250
’Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;	
Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains	
Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.	
“Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?	
“Know’st thou that man?” Poor Lamia answer’d not.	        255
He gaz’d into her eyes, and not a jot	
Own’d they the lovelorn piteous appeal:	
More, more he gaz’d: his human senses reel:	
Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;	
There was no recognition in those orbs.	        260
“Lamia!” he cried—and no soft-toned reply.	
The many heard, and the loud revelry	
Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;	
The myrtle sicken’d in a thousand wreaths.	
By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;	        265
A deadly silence step by step increased,	
Until it seem’d a horrid presence there,	
And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.	
“Lamia!” he shriek’d; and nothing but the shriek	
With its sad echo did the silence break.	        270
“Begone, foul dream!” he cried, gazing again	
In the bride’s face, where now no azure vein	
Wander’d on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom	
Misted the cheek; no passion to illume	
The deep-recessed vision:—all was blight;	        275
Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.	
“Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!	
“Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban	
“Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images	
“Here represent their shadowy presences,	        280
“May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn	
“Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,	
“In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright	
“Of conscience, for their long offended might,	
“For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,	        285
“Unlawful magic, and enticing lies.	
“Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!	
“Mark how, possess’d, his lashless eyelids stretch	
“Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!	
“My sweet bride withers at their potency.”	        290
“Fool!” said the sophist, in an under-tone	
Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan	
From Lycius answer’d, as heart-struck and lost,	
He sank supine beside the aching ghost.	
“Fool! Fool!” repeated he, while his eyes still	        295
Relented not, nor mov’d; “from every ill	
“Of life have I preserv’d thee to this day,	
“And shall I see thee made a serpent’s prey?	
Then Lamia breath’d death breath; the sophist’s eye,	
Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,	        300
Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well	
As her weak hand could any meaning tell,	
Motion’d him to be silent; vainly so,	
He look’d and look’d again a level—No!	
“A Serpent!” echoed he; no sooner said,	        305
Than with a frightful scream she vanished:	
And Lycius’ arms were empty of delight,	
As were his limbs of life, from that same night.	
On the high couch he lay!—his friends came round—	
Supported him—no pulse, or breath they found,	        310
And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.


 
A PITY beyond all telling	
Is hid in the heart of love:	
The folk who are buying and selling,	
The clouds on their journey above,	
The cold, wet winds ever blowing,	        5
And the shadowy hazel grove	
Where mouse-grey waters are flowing	
Threaten the head that I love.	
 
STRONG Son of God, immortal Love,	
  Whom we, that have not seen thy face,	
  By faith, and faith alone, embrace,	
Believing where we cannot prove;	
 
Thine are these orbs of light and shade;	        5
  Thou madest Life in man and brute;	
  Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot	
Is on the skull which thou hast made.	
 
Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:	
  Thou madest man, he knows not why;	        10
  He thinks he was not made to die;	
And thou hast made him: thou art just.	
 
Thou seemest human and divine,	
  The highest, holiest manhood, thou:	
  Our wills are ours, we know not how;	        15
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.	
 
Our little systems have their day;	
  They have their day and cease to be:	
  They are but broken lights of thee,	
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.	        20
 
We have but faith: we cannot know;	
  For knowledge is of things we see;	
  And yet we trust it comes from thee,	
A beam in darkness: let it grow.	
  
I WANT to die while you love me,	
  While yet you hold me fair,	
While laughter lies upon my lips	
  And lights are in my hair.	
 
I want to die while you love me,	        5
  And bear to that still bed,	
Your kisses turbulent, unspent	
  To warm me when I’m dead.	
 
I want to die while you love me	
  Oh, who would care to live	        10
Till love has nothing more to ask	
  And nothing more to give!	
 
I want to die while you love me	
  And never, never see	
The glory of this perfect day	        15
  Grow dim or cease to be.	
 


OVER the mountains	 
  And over the waves,	 
Under the fountains	 
  And under the graves;	 
Under floods that are deepest,	         5
  Which Neptune obey,	 
Over rocks that are steepest,	 
  Love will find out the way.	 
 
When there is no place	 
  For the glow-worm to lie,	  10
When there is no space	 
  For receipt of a fly;	 
When the midge dares not venture	 
  Lest herself fast she lay,	 
If Love come, he will enter	  15
  And will find out the way.	 
 
You may esteem him	 
  A child for his might;	 
Or you may deem him	 
  A coward for his flight;	  20
But if she whom Love doth honour	 
  Be conceal'd from the day—	 
Set a thousand guards upon her,	 
  Love will find out the way.	 
 
Some think to lose him	  25
  By having him confined;	 
And some do suppose him,	 
  Poor heart! to be blind;	 
But if ne'er so close ye wall him,	 
  Do the best that ye may,	  30
Blind Love, if so ye call him,	 
  He will find out his way.	 
 
You may train the eagle	 
  To stoop to your fist;	 
Or you may inveigle	  35
  The Phoenix of the east;	 
The lioness, you may move her	 
  To give over her prey;	 
But you'll ne'er stop a lover—	 
  He will find out the way.	  40
 
If the earth it should part him,	 
  He would gallop it o'er;	 
If the seas should o'erthwart him,	 
  He would swim to the shore;	 
Should his Love become a swallow,	  45
  Through the air to stray,	 
Love will lend wings to follow,	 
  And will find out the way.	 
 
There is no striving	 
  To cross his intent;	  50
There is no contriving	 
  His plots to prevent;	 
But if once the message greet him	 
  That his True Love doth stay,	 
If Death should come and meet him,	  55
  Love will find out the way!	 

 
WHAT word is that, that changeth not,	
Though it be turn’d and made in twain?	
It is mine Anna, God it wot,	
The only causer of my pain;	
My love that meedeth with disdain.	        5
  Yet is it loved, what will you more?	
  It is my salve, and eke my sore.	
 
  
I LOVE my life, but not too well	
  To give it to thee like a flower,	
So it may pleasure thee to dwell	
  Deep in its perfume but an hour.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        5
 
I love my life, but not too well	
  To sing it note by note away,	
So to thy soul the song may tell	
  The beauty of the desolate day.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        10
 
I love my life but not too well	
  To cast it like a cloak on thine,	
Against the storms that sound and swell	
  Between thy lonely heart and mine.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        15
 
 
PHŒBUS, 1 arise!	
And paint the sable skies	
With azure, white, and red;	
Rouse Memnon’s mother 2 from her Tithon’s bed,	
That she thy carriere 3 may with roses spread;	        5
The nightingales thy coming each-where sing;	
Make an eternal Spring!	
Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;	
Spread forth thy golden hair	
In larger locks than thou wast wont before,	        10
And emperor-like decore	
With diadem of pearl thy temples fair:	
Chase hence the ugly night	
Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light.	
—This is that happy morn,	        15
That day, long-wishèd day	
Of all my life so dark,	
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn	
And fates not hope betray),	
Which, only white, deserves	        20
A diamond for ever should it mark.	
This is the morn should bring unto this grove	
My Love, to hear and recompense my love.	
Fair King, who all preserves,	
But show thy blushing beams,	        25
And thou two sweeter eyes	
Shalt see than those which by Penèus’ streams 4	
Did once thy heart surprise.	
Nay, suns, which shine as clear	
As thou when two thou did to Rome appear. 5	        30
Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:	
If that ye, winds, would hear	
A voice surpassing far Amphion’s lyre,	
Your stormy chiding stay;	
Let Zephyr only breathe,	        35
And with her tresses play.	
Kissing sometimes these purple ports of death. 6	
—The winds all silent are,	
And Phœbus in his chair	
Ensaffroning sea and air	        40
Makes vanish every star:	
Night like a drunkard reels 7	
Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels:	
The fields with flowers are deck’d in every hue,	
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue; 8	        45
Here is the pleasant place—	
And everything, save Her, who all should grace.	
 
O LOVE, how thou art tired out with rhyme!	
Thou art a tree whereon all poets clime;	
And from thy branches every one takes some	
Of thy sweet fruit, which Fancy feeds upon.	
But now thy tree is left so bare and poor,	        5
That they can scarcely gather one plumb more.	
  
WHEN our glowing dreams were dead,	
Ruined our heroic piles,	
Something in your dark eyes said:	
“Think no more of love or smiles.”	
 
Something in me still would say,	        5
“Though our dreamland palace goes,	
I have seen how in decay	
Still the wild rose clings and blows.”	
 
But your dark eyes willed it thus:	
“Build our lofty dream again:	        10
Let our palace rise o’er us:	
Love can never be till then.”	
  
  SINCE love is such as that ye wot	
Cannot always be wisely used;	
I say therefore then blame me not,	
Though I therein have been abused.	
For as with cause I am accused,	        5
Guilty I grant such was my lot;	
And though it cannot be excused,	
Yet let such folly be forgot.	
  For in my years of reckless youth	
Methought the power of love so great;	        10
That to his laws I bound my truth,	
And to my will there was no let.	
Me list no more so far to fet;	
Such fruit! lo! as of love ensu’th;	
The gain was small that was to get,	        15
And of the loss the less the ruth.	
  And few there is but first or last,	
A time in love once shall they have;	
And glad I am my time is past,	
Henceforth my freedom to withsave.	        20
Now in my heart there shall I grave	
The granted grace that now I taste;	
Thanked be fortune that me gave	
So fair a gift, so sure and fast.	
  Now such as have me seen ere this,	        25
When youth in me set forth his kind;	
And folly framed my thought amiss,	
The fault whereof now well I find;	
Lo! since that so it is assign’d,	
That unto each a time there is,	        30
Then blame the lot that led my mind,	
Some time to live in love’s bliss.	
  But from henceforth I do protest,	
By proof of that that I have past,	
Shall never cease within my breast	        35
The power of Love so late outcast:	
The knot thereof is knit full fast,	
And I thereto so sure profess’d	
For evermore with me to last	
The power wherein I am possess’d.	        40
 
 
I SAW a vision yesternight	
Enough to sate a Seeker’s 1 sight;	
I wished myself a Shaker 2 there,	
And her quick pants my trembling sphere.	
It was a she so glittering bright,	        5
You’d think her soul an Adamite; 3	
A person of so rare a frame,	
Her body might be lined with the same.	
Beauty’s chiefest maid of honour,	
You may break Lent with looking on her.	        10
  Not the fair Abbess of the skies 4	
  With all her nunnery of eyes	
  Can show me such a glorious prize!	
 
And yet because ’tis more renown	
To make a shadow shine, she’s brown,—	        15
A brown for which Heaven would disband	
The galaxy and stars be tanned;	
Brown by reflection as her eye	
Dazzle’s the summer’s livery.	
Old dormant windows must confess	        20
Her beams their glimmering spectacles;	
Struck with the splendour of her face	
Do the office of a burning glass.	
  Now where such radiant lights have shown	
  No wonder if her cheeks be grown	        25
  Sunburned, with lustre of her own.	
 
My sight took pay but (thank my charms!)	
I now impale her in mine arms,—	
(Love’s compasses confining you,	
Good angels, to a circle too.)	        30
Is not the universe straight-laced	
When I can clasp it in the waist?	
My amorous folds about thee hurled	
With Drake I girdle in the world;	
I hoop the firmament, and make	        35
This, my embrace, the zodiac.	
  How could thy center take my sense	
  When admiration doth commence	
  At the extreme circumference?	
 
Now to the melting kiss that sips	        40
The jellied philtre of her lips;	
So sweet there is no tongue can praise’t	
Till transubstantiate with a taste.	
Inspired like Mahomet from above	
By the billing of my heavenly dove	        45
Love prints his signets in her smacks,	
Those ruddy drops of squeezing wax,	
Which, wheresoever she imparts,	
They’ve privy seals to take up hearts.	
  Our mouths encountering at the sport	        50
  My slippery soul had quit the fort	
  But that she stopped the sally-port.	
 
Next to these sweets, her lips dispence	
(As twin conserves of eloquence,)	
The sweet perfume of her breath affords,	        55
Incorporating with her words.	
No rosary this votress needs,—	
Her very syllables are beads;	
No sooner ’twixt those rubies born,	
But jewels are in ear-rings worn.	        60
With that delight her speech doth enter;	
It is a kiss of the second venter. 5	
  And I dissolve at what I hear	
  As if another Rosamond were	
  Couched in the labyrinth of my ear.	        65
  
WHEN I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced	
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	
When sometime-lofty towers I see down-razed,	
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	        5
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	
And the firm soil win of the watery main,	
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	
When I have seen such interchange of state,	
Or state itself confounded to decay,—	        10
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate—	
That Time will come and take my Love away.	
  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose	
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	
 
FAST-ANCHOR’D, eternal, O love! O woman I love!	 
O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of you!	 
—Then separate, as disembodied, or another born,	 
Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation;	 
I ascend—I float in the regions of your love, O man,	         5
O sharer of my roving life.

Translated by Sir Thomas Wyatt

I FIND no peace, and all my war is done;	
  I fear and hope, I burn and freeze likewise;	
  I fly above the wind, yet cannot rise;	
  And nought I have, yet all the world I seize on;	
That looseth, nor locketh, holdeth me in prison,	        5
  And holds me not, yet can I ’scape no wise;	
  Nor lets me live, nor die, at my devise,	
  And yet of death it giveth none occasion.	
Without eyes I see, and without tongue I plain;	
  I wish to perish, yet I ask for health;	        10
  I love another, and yet I hate myself;	
I feed in sorrow, and laugh in all my pain;	
  Lo, thus displeaseth me both death and life,	
  And my delight is causer of my grief.	
 
AND Prevye Thought, rejoycing of hym-self,	
Stode not fer thens in abite mervelous;	
‘Yon is,’ thought I, ‘som sprite or [els] som elf,	
His sotill image is so curious:	
How is,’ quod I, ‘that he is shaded thus	        5
With yonder cloth, I note 1 of what coloure?’	
And nere I went and gan to lere and pore,	
 
And framed him a question full hard.	
‘What is,’ quod I, ‘the thyng thou lovest best?	
Or what is bote 2 unto thy paynës hard?	        10
Me think thou livest here in grete unrest,	
Thow wandrest ay from south to est and west,	
And est to north; as fer as I can see,	
There is no place in courte may holden the.	
 
‘Whom folowest thow? where is thy harte iset?	        15
But my demaunde asoile 3 I thee require.’	
‘Me thoughte,’ quod he, ‘no creature may lette	
Me to ben here and where as I desire:	
For where as absence hath don out the fire,	
My mery thought it kyndelith yet agayn,	        20
That bodily me thinke with my souverayne	
 
‘I stand and speke, and laugh, and kisse, and halse, 4	
So that my thought comforteth me ful ofte:	
I think, God wot, though all the world be false,	
I wil be trewe; I think also how softe	        25
My lady is in speche, and this on-lofte	
Bryngeth myn harte in joye and grete gladnesse;	
This prevey thought alayeth myne hevynesse.	
 
‘And what I thinke or where to be, no man	
In all this erth can tell, iwis, but I:	        30
And eke there nys no swalowe swifte, ne swan	
So wight 5 of wyng, ne half so yerne 6 can flye;	
For I can ben, and that right sodenly,	
In Heven, in Helle, in Paradise, and here,	
And with my lady, whan I wil desire.	        35
 
‘I am of councell ferre and wide, I wot,

And gladden hem all while the feste shall laste:	
And therewithal a loughter out he braste,	
‘I thanke it God that I shuld ende the song,	
And all the service which hath ben so long.’	
 
Thus sange thay all the service of the feste,	        50
And that was done right erly, to my dome; 10	
And furth goth all the courte, bothe moste and leste,	
To feche the flourës fressh, and braunche and blome;	
And namly hawthorn brought both page and grome,	
With fressh garlantis, partie blewe and white,	        55
And hem rejoysen in her grete delite.	
 
HE who knows Love—becomes Love, and his eyes	
  Behold Love in the heart of everyone,	
  Even the loveless: as the light of the sun	
Is one with all it touches. He is wise	
With undivided wisdom, for he lies	        5
  In Wisdom’s arms. His wanderings are done,	
  For he has found the Source whence all things run—	
The guerdon of the quest, that satisfies.	
 LOVE 1 guards the roses of thy lips	
  And flies about them like a bee;	
If I approach he forward skips,	
  And if I kiss he stingeth me.	
  
(1917)

I WALK alone and cry out under the stars.	
As one in a desert I hunger for refreshment.	
I have need of the coolness of some azure pool.	
O, I would anoint my bosom with the clear water!	
O, I would immerse myself in the emulous depths!	        5
O, I would drink of ineffable dreams.	
You, Beloved, are the silvery lake shimmering in the desert of my youth.	
You only can allay the fever of my spirit!	
On your lips I should drain the fountain of life.	
On your white breast I shall breath the perfume of numberless lilies.	        10
Therein I shall die a thousand deaths and arise reborn in the awful splendor of your love….
*        *        *        *        *
LAY your hands,—softer than dove’s wings,—in my hands so I may feel your young life flowing into mine thro’ your finger-tips.	
Lay your eyes upon my eyes that I may grow tremulous beneath the flutter of your eyelids.	
Lay your heart against my heart that I may hear your love summoning me to forgetfulness.	
Lay your tresses about me that I may feel their warm sun streaming thro’ my veins.	        15
Lay your mouth on my mouth until all dissolves in mist about me….	
                (Is it life? Is it death?)
*        *        *        *        *
YOU are as a million birds that sing unto my heart, O, Beloved.	
Thro’ the long nights I hear the chanting of blithe voices.	
What divine minstrelsy! what ravishment….	        20
Is this multitudinous melody the rapture of your kiss?	
Come to me, press upon my brow the coolness of your young lips that I may hear the thunder of your love in the night….
*        *        *        *        *
When will it end, the long vigil….	
What dawn will bring you forever unto me, O, my Beloved?	
Life is but shadow.	        25
Only you, my Beloved, are more real than shadow.	
Beneath your caresses I am as one awakened unto life.	
Your finger-tips bear presage of divinity. Your heart-beats are a threnody sublime.	
O, Beloved, you are as a white nenuphar lifting its snowy breast on a stream. In your bosom are all the treasures of Elysium. The scent of your skin is like jasmine and honeysuckle.	
Why is such loveliness withheld from me, O, Beloved?	        30
When can I look upon you and say: “Beloved! all this beauty is mine forever.”	
When will it end, the long vigil….
*        *        *        *        *
O, MIRACLE of love!	
You whom I adore unto delirium,	
Your arms are white lilies upon my bosom.	        35
Stars encircle me when your lips lean down to mine. There is the sound of many waters falling. There is the murmur of a million nightingales,—and the flash of brilliant lightning.	
Caress celestial!	
Moon-path of my dreams!	
O, miracle of Love—my divinity and my crucifixion….
*        *        *        *        *
WHEN the young moon silvers the sky, the earth is ours,	        40
We shall go into the forest and wander in the shadow of the pines.	
I shall cover you with leaves, and we shall lie on the soft moss entwined like sisters.	
And all the while I will know that the fragrance of your skin is sweeter to me than the perfumes of a million roses….
*        *        *        *        *
LET me enfold you in my hair.	
Let me wind you as in a golden skein.	        45
Give me the curve of your throat, milky white and rose, that I may place about it the glossy fillets of my hair.	
Don it as a shining mantilla….	
Let my hair shower about you until you are radiant with perfume;	
Let it ripple over you like the wind on summer wheat.	
Then give me your lips that we may stand united beneath the downpour of its sunlight.	        50
Let us be intermingled as two trees that have bent one single root….
*        *        *        *        *
IT rains, Beloved….	
The dripping of the rain is like the cool kisses of your mouth….	
I faint beneath the rapture of your lips.	
Be no longer tender.	        55
Cover me with frenzied kisses,—even as I would drench my body in the cruel torrents of the rain.	
Envelop me from throat to ankle in delirium intolerable….	
*        *        *        *        *
TO love you like the midnight storm!	
To take you swooning unto death as the wind sweeps the waves in tempest!	        60
To transport you unto delirium!	
To hear the wild beating of your veins; to feel flame shuddering your blood and to agonize you with my ardor.	
To crush you as a flower upon my breast,	
To bear you away to some secret valley where I would love you unto insensibility….
*        *        *        *        *
IF I think of you, I quiver from head to foot.	        65
If I think of you tears flood my eyes.	
If I pass you my heart quickens to suffocation and the blood seems to leave my body.	
If I look into your eyes a sudden fire burns in my veins.	
If I touch you I am as one possessed with madness; my arms tremble and my limbs totter beneath me.	
To love you is to suffer the pangs of an intolerable agony.
*        *        *        *        *

PART FIRST
MY dear and only love, I pray,	
  This noble world of thee	
Be governed by no other sway	
  But purest monarchie.	
For if confusion have a part,	        5
  Which virtuous souls abhore,	
And hold a synod in thy heart,	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	
 
Like Alexander I will reign,	
  And I will reign alone,	        10
My thoughts shall evermore disdain	
  A rival on my throne.	
He either fears his fate too much,	
  Or his deserts are small,	
That puts it not unto the touch,	        15
  To win or lose it all.	
 
But I must rule and govern still	
  And always give the law,	
And have each subject at my will,	
  And all to stand in awe.	        20
But ’gainst my battery if I find	
  Thou shun’st the prize so sore	
As that thou set’st me up a blind,	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	
 
If in the empire of thy heart,	        25
  Where I should solely be,	
Another do pretend a part,	
  And dares to vie with me;	
Or if committees thou erect,	
  And go on such a score,	        30
I ’ll sing and laugh at thy neglect,	
  And never love thee more.	
 
But if thou wilt be constant then,	
  And faithful of thy word,	
I ’ll make thee glorious by my pen,	        35
  And famous by my sword.	
I ’ll serve thee in such noble ways	
  Was never heard before;	
I ’ll crown and deck thee all with bays,	
  And love thee ever more.	        40
 
PART SECOND
My dear and only love, take heed,	
  Lest thou thyself expose,	
And let all longing lovers feed	
  Upon such looks as those.	
A marble wall then build about,	        45
  Beset without a door;	
But if thou let thy heart fly out,	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	
 
Let not their oaths, like volleys shot,	
  Make any breach at all;	        50
Nor smoothness of their language plot	
  Which way to scale the wall;	
Nor balls of wild-fire love consume	
  The shrine which I adore;	
For if such smoke about thee fume,	        55
  I ’ll never love thee more.	
 
I think thy virtues be too strong	
  To suffer by surprise;	
Those victualled by my love so long,	
  The siege at length must rise,	        60
And leave thee rulèd in that health	
  And state thou wast before;	
But if thou turn a commonwealth,	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	
 
Or if by fraud, or by consent,	        65
  Thy heart to ruine come,	
I ’ll sound no trumpet as I wont,	
  Nor march by tuck of drum;	
But hold my arms, like ensigns, up,	
  Thy falsehood to deplore,	        70
And bitterly will sigh and weep,	
  And never love thee more.	
 
I ’ll do with thee as Nero did	
  When Rome was set on fire,	
Not only all relief forbid,	        75
  But to a hill retire,	
And scorn to shed a tear to see	
  Thy spirit grown so poor;	
But smiling sing, until I die,	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	        80
 
Yet, for the love I bare thee once,	
  Lest that thy name should die,	
A monument of marble-stone	
  The truth shall testifie;	
That every pilgrim passing by	        85
  May pity and deplore	
My case, and read the reason why	
  I can love thee no more.	
 
The golden laws of love shall be	
  Upon this pillar hung,—	        90
A simple heart, a single eye,	
  A true and constant tongue;	
Let no man for more love pretend	
  Than he has hearts in store;	
True love begun shall never end;	        95
  Love one and love no more.	
 
Then shall thy heart be set by mine,	
  But in far different case;	
For mine was true, so was not thine,	
  But lookt like Janus’ face.	        100
For as the waves with every wind,	
  So sail’st thou every shore,	
And leav’st my constant heart behind,—	
  How can I love thee more?	
 
My heart shall with the sun be fixed	        105
  For constancy most strange,	
And thine shall with the moon be mixed,	
  Delighting ay in change.	
Thy beauty shined at first more bright,	
  And woe is me therefore,	        110
That ever I found thy love so light	
  I could love thee no more!	
 
The misty mountains, smoking lakes,	
  The rocks’ resounding echo,	
The whistling wind that murmur makes,	        115
  Shall with me sing hey ho!	
The tossing seas, the tumbling boats,	
  Tears dropping from each shore,	
Shall tune with me their turtle notes—	
  I ’ll never love thee more.	        120
 
As doth the turtle, chaste and true,	
  Her fellow’s death regrete,	
And daily mourns for his adieu,	
  And ne’er renews her mate;	
So, though thy faith was never fast,	        125
  Which grieves me wondrous sore,	
Yet I shall live in love so chaste,	
  That I shall love no more.	
 
And when all gallants ride about	
  These monuments to view,	        130
Whereon is written, in and out,	
  Thou traitorous and untrue;	
Then in a passion they shall pause,	
  And thus say, sighing sore,	
“Alas! he had too just a cause	        135
  Never to love thee more.”	
 
And when that tracing goddess Fame	
  From east to west shall flee,	
She shall record it, to thy shame,	
  How thou hast lovèd me;	        140
And how in odds our love was such	
  As few have been before;	
Thou loved too many, and I too much,	
  So I can love no more.	
 
LOVE thou thy land, with love far-brought	
  From out the storied past, and used	
  Within the present, but transfused	
Thro’ future time by power of thought;	
 
True love turn’d round on fixed poles,	        5
  Love, that endures not sordid ends,	
  For English natures, freemen, friends,	
Thy brothers, and immortal souls.	
 
But pamper not a hasty time,	
  Nor feed with crude imaginings	        10
  The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings	
That every sophister can lime.	
 
Deliver not the tasks of might	
  To weakness, neither hide the ray	
  From those, not blind, who wait for day,	        15
Tho’ sitting girt with doubtful light.	
 
Make knowledge circle with the winds;	
  But let her herald, Reverence, fly	
  Before her to whatever sky	
Bear seed of men and growth of minds.	        20
 
Watch what main-currents draw the years:	
  Cut Prejudice against the grain.	
  But gentle words are always gain;	
Regard the weakness of thy peers.	
 
Nor toil for title, place, or touch	        25
  Of pension, neither count on praise	
  It grows to guerdon after-days.	
Nor deal in watch-words overmuch;	
 
Not clinging to some ancient saw,	
  Not master’d by some modern term,	        30
  Not swift nor slow to change, but firm;	
And in its season bring the law,	
 
That from Discussion’s lip may fall	
  With Life that, working strongly, binds—	
  Set in all lights by many minds,	        35
To close the interests of all.	
 
For Nature also, cold and warm,	
  And moist and dry, devising long,	
  Thro’ many agents making strong,	
Matures the individual form.	        40
 
Meet is it changes should control	
  Our being, lest we rust in ease.	
  We all are changed by still degrees,	
All but the basis of the soul.	
 
So let the change which comes be free	        45
  To ingroove itself with that which flies,	
  And work, a joint of state, that plies	
Its office, moved with sympathy.	
 
A saying hard to shape in act;	
  For all the past of Time reveals	        50
  A bridal dawn of thunder-peals,	
Wherever Thought hath wedded Fact.	
 
Even now we hear with inward strife	
  A motion toiling in the gloom—	
  The Spirit of the years to come	        55
Yearning to mix himself with Life.	
 
A slow-develop’d strength awaits	
  Completion in a painful school;	
  Phantoms of other forms of rule,	
New Majesties of mighty States—	        60
 
The warders of the growing hour,	
  But vague in vapor, hard to mark;	
  And round them sea and air are dark	
With great contrivances of Power.	
 
Of many changes, aptly join’d,	        65
  Is bodied forth the second whole.	
  Regard gradation, lest the soul	
Of Discord race the rising wind;	
 
A wind to puff your idol-fires,	
  And heap their ashes on the head;	        70
  To shame the boast so often made,	
That we are wiser than our sires.	
 
O, yet, if Nature’s evil star	
  Drive men in manhood, as in youth,	
  To follow flying steps of Truth	        75
Across the brazen bridge of war—	
 
If New and Old, disastrous feud,	
  Must ever shock, like armed foes,	
  And this be true, till Time shall close	
That Principles are rain’d in blood;	        80
 
Not yet the wise of heart would cease	
  To hold his hope thro’ shame and guilt,	
  But with his hand against the hilt,	
Would pace the troubled land, like Peace;	
 
Not less, tho’ dogs of Faction bay,	        85
  Would serve his kind in deed and word,	
  Certain, if knowledge bring the sword,	
That knowledge takes the sword away—	
 
Would love the gleams of love that broke	
  From either side, nor veil his eyes;	        90
  And if some dreadful need should rise	
Would strike, and firmly, and one stroke.	
 
To-morrow yet would reap to-day,	
  As we bear blossom of the dead;	
  Earn well the thrifty months, nor wed	        95
Raw Haste, half-sister to Delay.
I SEE you coming toward me….	

WHAT have I to say to you	
When we shall meet?	
Yet—	
I lie here thinking of you.	
 
  The stain of love	        5
Is upon the world.	
Yellow, yellow, yellow,	
It eats into the leaves,	
Smears with saffron	
The horned branches that lean	        10
Heavily	
Against a smooth purple sky.	
 
  There is no light—	
Only a honey-thick stain	
That drips from leaf to leaf	        15
And limb to limb,	
Spoiling the colors	
Of the whole world.	
 
  I am alone.	
The weight of love	        20
Has buoyed me up	
Till my head	
Knocks against the sky.	
 
  See me!	
My hair is dripping with nectar—	        25
Starlings carry it	
On their black wings.	
See, at last	
My arms and my hands	
Are lying idle.	        30
 
  How can I tell	
If I shall ever love you again	

 
SHE casts a spell, oh, casts a spell!	
Which haunts me more than I can tell.	
Dearer, because she makes me ill	
Than who would will to make me well.	
 
She is my store! oh, she my store!	        5
Whose grey eye wounded me so sore,	
Who will not place in mine her palm,	
Nor love, nor calm me any more.	
 
She is my pet, oh, she my pet!	
Whom I can never more forget;	        10
Who would not lose by me one moan,	
Nor stone upon my cairn would set.	
 
She is my roon, oh, she my roon!	
Who tells me nothing, leaves me soon;	
Who would not lose by me one sigh,	        15
Were death and I within one room.	
 
She is my dear, oh, she my dear!	
Who cares not whether I be here.	
Who will not weep when I am dead,	
But makes me shed the silent tear.	        20
 
Hard my case, oh, hard my case!	
For in her eye no hope I trace,	
She will not hear me any more,	
But I adore her silent face.	
 
She is my choice, oh, she my choice!	        25
Who never made me to rejoice;	
Who caused my heart to ache so oft,	
Who put no softness in her voice.	
 
Great my grief, oh, great my grief!	
Neglected, scorned beyond belief,	        30
By her who looks at me askance,	
By her who grants me no relief.	
 
She’s my desier, oh, my desire!	
More glorious than the bright sun’s fire;	
Who were than wild-blown ice more cold	        35
Were I so bold as to sit by her.	
 
She it is who stole my heart,	
And left a void and aching smart;	
But if she soften not her eye,	
I know that life and I must part.

 
JESUS! why dost Thou love me so?	
  What hast Thou seen in me	
To make my happiness so great,	
  So dear a joy to Thee?	
 
Wert Thou not God, I then might think	        5
  Thou hadst no eye to read	
The badness of that selfish heart,	
  For which Thine own did bleed.	
 
But Thou art God, and knowest all;	
  Dear Lord! Thou knowest me;	        10
And yet Thy knowledge hinders not	
  Thy love’s sweet liberty.	
 
Ah, how Thy grace hath wooed my soul	
  With persevering wiles!	
Now give me tears to weep; for tears	        15
  Are deeper joy than smiles.	
 
Each proof renewed of Thy great love	
  Humbles me more and more,	
And brings to light forgotten sins,	
  And lays them at my door.	        20
 
The more I love Thee, Lord! the more	
  I hate my own cold heart;	
The more Thou woundest me with love,	
  The more I feel the smart.	
 
What shall I do, then, dearest Lord!	        25
  Say, shall I fly from Thee,	
And hide my poor unloving self	


BEHOLD, thou art fair, my love; behold thou art fair;	
Thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks:	
Thy hair is as a flock of goats,	
That appear from mount Gilead.	
Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn,	        5
Which came up from the washing;	
Whereof every one bear twins,	
And none is barren among them.	
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,	
And thy speech is comely:	        10
Thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate	
Within thy locks.	
Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory,	
Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,	
All shields of mighty men.	        15
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins,	
Which feed among the lilies.	
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,	
I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,	
And to the hill of frankincense.	        20
Thou art all fair, my love;	
There is no spot in thee.	
Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse,	
With me from Lebanon:	
Look from the top of Amana,	        25
From the top of Shenir and Hermon,	
From the lions’ dens,	
From the mountains of the leopards.	
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;	
Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,	        30
With one chain of thy neck.	
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse!	
How much better is thy love than wine!	
And the smell of thine ointments than all spices!	
Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb:	        35
Honey and milk are under thy tongue;	
And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.	
A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;	
A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.	
Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits:	        40
Camphire, with spikenard,	
Spikenard and saffron;	
Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense;	
Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:	
A fountain of gardens,	        45
A well of living waters,	
And streams from Lebanon.	
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south:	
Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.	
Let my beloved come into his garden,	        50
And eat his pleasant fruits.
I LOVE my life, but not too well	
  To give it to thee like a flower,	
So it may pleasure thee to dwell	
  Deep in its perfume but an hour.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        5
 
I love my life, but not too well	
  To sing it note by note away,	
So to thy soul the song may tell	
  The beauty of the desolate day.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        10
 
I love my life, but not too well	
  To cast it like a cloak on thine,	
Against the storms that sound and swell	
  Between thy lonely heart and mine.	
I love my life, but not too well.	        15
 
II
Your love is like a blue blue wave	
  The little rainbows play in.	
Your love is like a mountain cave	
  Cool shadows darkly stay in.	
 
It thrills me like great gales at war,	        20
  It soothes like softest singing.	
It bears me where clear rivers are,	
  With reeds and rushes swinging;	
Or out to pearly shores afar	
  Where temple bells are ringing.	        25
  
LOVE, Fortune, and my mind which do remember	
Eke that is now, and that, that once hath ben,	
Torment my heart so sore, that very often	
I hate and envy them beyond all measure.	
Love slayeth mine heart, while Fortune is depriver	        5
Of all my comfort; the foolish mind then	
Burneth and plaineth, as one that very seldome	
Liveth in rest. So still in displeasure	
My pleasant days they fleet and pass;	
And daily doth mine ill change to the worse:	        10
While more than half is run now of my course.	
Alas, not of steel, but of brittle glass,	
  I see that from my hand falleth my trust,	
  And all my thoughts are dashed into dust.	
 
 COULD Love for ever	
          Run like a river,	
          And Time’s endeavour	
            Be tried in vain—	
          No other pleasure	        5
          With this could measure:	
          And like a treasure	
            We’d hug the chain.	
          But since our sighing	
          Ends not in dying,	        10
          And, form’d for flying,	
            Love plumes his wing;	
          Then for this reason	
          Let’s love a season;	
But let that season be only Spring.	        15
 
          When lovers parted	
          Feel broken-hearted,	
          And, all hopes thwarted,	
            Expect to die;	
          A few years older,	        20
          Ah! how much colder	
          They might behold her	
            For whom they sigh!	
          When link’d together,	
          In every weather,	        25
          They pluck Love’s feather	
            From out his wing—	
          He’ll stay for ever,	
          But sadly shiver	
Without his plumage, when past the Spring.	        30
 
          Like Chiefs of Faction,	
          His life is action—	
          A formal paction	
            That curbs his reign,	
          Obscures his glory,	        35
          Despot no more, he	
          Such territory	
            Quits with disdain.	
          Still, still advancing,	
          With banners glancing,	        40
          His power enhancing,	
            He must move on—	
          Repose but cloys him,	
          Retreat destroys him,	
Love brooks not a degraded throne.	        45
 
          Wait not, fond lover!	
          Till years are over,	
          And then recover,	
            As from a dream.	
          While each bewailing	        50
          The other’s failing,	
          With wrath and railing,	
            All hideous seem—	
          While first decreasing,	
          Yet not quite ceasing,	        55
          Wait not till teasing	
            All passion blight:	
          If once diminish’d	
          Love reign is finish’d—	
Then part in friendship,—and bid good-night.	        60
 
          So shall Affection	
          To recollection	
          The dear connection	
            Bring back with joy:	
          You had not waited	        65
          Till, tired or hated,	
          Your passions sated	
            Began to coy.	
          Your last embraces	
          Leave no cold traces—	        70
          The same fond faces—	
            As through the past;	
          And eyes, the mirrors	
          Of your sweet errors,	
Reflect but rapture—not least though last.	        75
  O FAIREST of creation, last and best	
Of all God’s works, creature in whom excelled	
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,	
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!	
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,	        5
Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!	
Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress	
The strict forbiddance, how to violate	
The sacred fruit forbidden! Some cursèd fraud	
Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,	        10
And me with thee hath ruined, for with thee	
Certain my resolution is to die.	
How can I live without thee, how forego	
Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,	
To live again in these wild woods forlorn?	        15
Should God create another Eve, and I	
Another rib afford, yet loss of thee	
Would never from my heart; no, no, I feel	
The link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh,	
Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state	        20
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
*        *        *        *        *
However, I with thee have fixed my lot,	
Certain to undergo like doom; if death	
Consort with thee, death is to me as life;	
So forcible within my heart I feel	        25
The bond of nature draw me to my own,	
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;	
Our state cannot be severed, we are one,	
One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.	
          True, separations	
          Ask more than patience;	

Have at you, then, affection’s men at arms.	
Consider what you first did swear unto,—	        10
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;	
Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.	
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young,	
And abstinence engenders maladies.	
And where that you have vowed to study, lords,	        15
In that each of you have forsworn his book,	
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?	
For when would you, my lord,—or you,—or you,—	
Have found the ground of study’s excellence	
Without the beauty of a woman’s face?	        20
From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:	
They are the ground, the books, the academes,	
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.	
Why, universal plodding poisons up	
The nimble spirits in the arteries,	        25
As motion and long-during action tires	
The sinewy vigor of the traveller.	
Now, for not looking on a woman’s face,	
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,	
And study too, the causer of your vow;	        30
For where is any author in the world	
Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye?	
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,	
And where we are our learning likewise is;	
Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes,	        35
Do we not likewise see our learning there?	
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,	
And in that vow we have forsworn our books;	
For when would you, my liege,—or you,—or you,—	
In leaden contemplation have found out	        40
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes	
Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?	
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,	
And therefore, finding barren practisers,	
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;	        45
But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,	
Lives not alone immured in the brain,	
But, with the motion of all elements,	
Courses as swift as thought in every power,	
And gives to every power a double power,	        50
Above their functions and their offices.	
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;	
A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind;	
A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,	
When the suspicious head of theft is stopped;	        55
Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible	
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails;	
Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste;	
For valor, is not Love a Hercules,	
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?	        60
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical	
As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair;	
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods	
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.	
Never durst poet touch a pen to write	        65
Until his ink were tempered with Love’s sighs;	
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears	
And plant in tyrants mild humility!	
From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:	
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;	        70
They are the books, the arts, the academes,	
That show, contain, and nourish all the world,	
Else none at all in aught proves excellent.	
Then fools you were these women to forswear,	
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.	        75
For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,	
Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,	
Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,	
Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,	
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,	        80
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.	
It is religion to be thus forsworn,	
For charity itself fulfils the law,—	
And who can sever love from charity?	
 . LOVE 1 will teach us all things: but we must learn how to win love; it is got with difficulty: it is a possession dearly bought with much labour and in long time; for one must love not sometimes only, for a passing moment, but always. There is no man who doth not sometimes love: even the wicked can do that.	  1
  And let not men’s sin dishearten thee: love a man even in his sin, for that love is a likeness of the divine love, and is the summit of love on earth. Love all God’s creation, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf, every ray of light. Love the animals, love the plants, love each separate thing. If thou love each thing thou wilt perceive the mystery of God in all; and when once thou perceive this, thou wilt thenceforward grow every day to a fuller understanding of it: until thou come at last to love the whole world with a love that will then be all-embracing and universal.
 
‘The Ring and the Book’

O LYRIC Love, half-angel and half-bird	
And all a wonder and a wild desire,—	
Boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun,	
Took sanctuary within the holier blue,	
And sang a kindred soul out to his face,—	        5
Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart—	
When the first summons from the darkling earth	
Reach’d thee amid thy chambers, blanch’d their blue,	
And bared them of the glory—to drop down,	
To toil for man, to suffer or to die,—	        10
This is the same voice: can thy soul know change?	
Hail then, and hearken from the realms of help!	
Never may I commence my song, my due	
To God who best taught song by gift of thee,	
Except with bent head and beseeching hand—	        15
That still, despite the distance and the dark,	
What was, again may be; some interchange	
Of grace, some splendour once thy very thought,	
Some benediction anciently thy smile:	
—Never conclude, but raising hand and head	        20
Thither where eyes, that cannot reach, yet yearn	
For all hope, all sustainment, all reward,	
Their utmost up and on,—so blessing back	
In those thy realms of help, that heaven thy home,	
Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,	        25
Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall!
 
NEVER 1 seek to tell thy love,	
Love that never told can be;	
For the gentle wind does move	
Silently, invisibly.	
 
I told my love, I told my love,	        5
I told her all my heart;	
Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears,	
Ah! she doth depart.	
 
Soon as she was gone from me,	
A traveller came by,	        10
Silently, invisibly:	
He took her with a sigh.
          What desperations	
            From such have risen!	
          But yet remaining,	        80
          What is’t but chaining	
          Hearts which, once waning,	
            Beat ’gainst their prison?	
          Time can but cloy love,	
          And use destroy love:	        85
          The wingèd boy, Love,	
            Is but for boys—	
          You’ll find it torture	
          Though sharper, shorter,	
To wean, and not wear out your joys.
III
And is it pain to you	
  That we must love and part?	
Ah, if you only knew	
  The gladness in my heart!	
 
Love is enough. Each day	        30
  I look upon the sun,	
He loves me! I shall say,	
  Now is my life begun.	
 
He loves me! Every night,	
  On the dark verge of sleep	        35
The rapture will alight	
  And to my bosom creep.	
 
Peace, for I should not dare	
  A keener joy implore.	
My soul shall feel no care—	        40
  Until you love no more.
FOR aught that ever I could read,	
Could ever hear by tale or history,	
The course of true love never did run smooth:	
But, either it was different in blood,	
Or else misgraffèd in respect of years,	        5
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends;	
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,	
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,	
Making it momentary as a sound,	
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;	        10
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,	
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,	
And ere a man hath power to say,—Behold!	
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:	
So quick bright things come to confusion.
CHILDREN born of fairy stock	
Never need for shirt or frock,	
Never want for food or fire,	
Always get their heart’s desire:	
Jingle pockets full of gold,	        5
Marry when they’re seven years old.	
Every fairy child may keep	
Two strong ponies and ten sheep;	
All have houses, each his own,	
Built of brick or granite stone;	        10
They live on cherries, they run wild—	
I’d love to be a Fairy’s child.	

PALE brows, still hands and dim hair,	 
I had a beautiful friend	 
And dreamed that the old despair	 
Would end in love in the end:	 
She looked in my heart one day	         5
And saw your image was there;	 
She has gone weeping away.	 

  Where Thou canst never see?	
 
Or shall I pray that Thy dear love	
  To me might not be given?	        30
Ah, no! love must be pain on earth,	
  If it be bliss in Heaven.
LOVE is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,	
  Where that comes in that shall not go again;	
Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate.	
  They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then,	
When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,	        5
  And agony’s forgot, and hushed the crying	
Of credulous hearts, in heaven—such are but taking	
  Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying	
Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.	
  Some share that night. But they know love grows colder,	       10
Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most.	
  Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,	
But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.	
All this is love; and all love is but this.	

As I do now?	
Our lips meet and our eyes close.	
I feel the shuddering of your breast and the beating of your throat against mine.	
We are enveloped in darkness.	        75
We know nothing but the thunder of our veins….	
We are swept out into a sea of infinite oblivion.
Love in thine eyes doth build his tower,	        5
  And sleeps within his pretty shrine;	
And if I look the boy will lower,	
  And from their orbs shoot shafts divine.	
 
Love works thy heart within his fire,	
  And in my tears doth firm the same;	        10
And if I tempt it will retire,	
  And of my plaints doth make a game.	
  
TO him who ever thought with love of me	
Or ever did for my sake some good deed	
I will appear, looking such charity	
And kind compassion, at his life’s last need	
That he will out of hand and heartily	        5
Repent he sinned and all his sins be freed.	
FAIR is my love, when her fair golden hairs	
With the loose wind ye waving chance to mark;	
Fair, when the rose in her red cheeks appears;	
Or in her eyes the fire of love does spark.	
Fair, when her breast, like a rich-laden bark,	        5
With precious merchandise she forth doth lay;	
Fair, when that cloud of pride, which oft doth dark	
Her goodly light, with smiles she drives away.	
But fairest she, when so she doth display	
The gate with pearls and rubies richly dight;	        10
Through which her words so wise do make their way	
To bear the message of her gentle sprite.	
  The rest be works of nature’s wonderment:	
  But this the work of heart’s astonishment.	
 
LIKE a cradle rocking, rocking,	
  Silent, peaceful, to and fro,	
Like a mother’s sweet looks dropping	
  On the little face below,	
Hangs the green earth, swinging, turning,	        5
  Jarless, noiseless, safe, and slow;	
Falls the light of God’s face bending	
  Down and watching us below.	
 
And as feeble babes that suffer,	
  Toss, and cry, and will not rest,	        10
Are the ones the tender mother	
  Holds the closest, loves the best,—	
So when we are weak and wretched,	
  By our sins weighed down, distressed,	
Then it is that God’s great patience	        15
  Holds us closest, loves us best.	

Love, let me cull her choicest flowers;	
  And pity me, and calm her eye;	
Make soft her heart, dissolve her lowers;	        15
  Then will I praise thy deity.	
 
But if thou do not, Love, I’ll truly serve her	
In spite of thee, and by firm faith deserve her.	

He who knows Love becomes Love, and he knows	
  All beings are himself, twin-born of Love.	       10
Melted in Love’s own fire, his spirit flows	
  Into all earthly forms, below, above;	
He is the breath and glamour of the rose,	
  He is the benediction of the dove.	

Eke eche at other threw the flourës brighte,	
The prymerose, the violet, and the golde; 11	
So than, as I beheld the riall 12 sighte,	
My lady gan me sodenly beholde,	        60
And with a trewe love, plited many-folde,	
She smote me thrugh the very harte as blive, 13	
And Venus yet I thanke I am alive.	


Yet that’s but a preludious bliss,	
Two souls pickeering in a kiss.	
Embraces do but draw the line,	
’Tis storming that must take her in.	
When bodies join and victory hovers	        70
’Twixt the equal fluttering lovers,	
This is the game; make stakes, my dear!	
Hark, how the sprightly chanticleer,	
(That Baron Tell-clock of the night,)	
Sounds boutesel to Cupid’s knight.	        75
  Then have at all, the pass is got,	
  For coming off, oh, name it not!	
  Who would not die upon the spot?	


THE TWILIGHT fleeted away in pearl on the stream,	
And night, like a diamond done, stood still in our dream.	
Your eyes like burnished stones or as stars were bright	
With the sudden vision that made us one with the night.	
 
We loved in infinite spaces, forgetting here	        5
The breasts that were lit with life and the lips so near;	
Till the wizard willows waved in the wind and drew	
Me away from the fulness of love and down to you.	
 
Our love was so vast that it filled the heavens up:	
But the soft white form I held was an empty cup,	        10
When the willows called me back to earth with their sigh,	
And we moved as shades through the deep that was you and I.




Let knowledge grow from more to more,	        25
  But more of reverence in us dwell;	
  That mind and soul, according well,	
May make one music as before,	
 
But vaster. We are fools and slight;	
  We mock thee when we do not fear:	        30
  But help thy foolish ones to bear;	
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.	
 
Forgive what seemed my sin in me;	
  What seemed my worth since I began;	
  For merit lives from man to man,	        35
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.	
 
Forgive my grief for one removed,	
  Thy creature, whom I found so fair.	
  I trust he lives in thee, and there	
I find him worthier to be loved.	        40
 
Forgive these wild and wandering cries,	
  Confusions of a wasted youth;	
  Forgive them where they fail in truth,	
And in thy wisdom make me wise.	
1 
OH, love as long as you can love,	
Oh, love as long as love you may!	
The hour will come, the hour will come:	
By graves lamenting you will stay.	
 
And ever keep your heart aglow,	        5
And let it foster love with care,	
As long as still another heart	
Beats with it warmly anywhere.	
 
If one unseals his breast to you,	
Ah, do him all the good you can—	        10
And all his hours with gladness fill,	
And grieve him not for one hour’s span!	
 
Your tongue—ah, hold it well in check!—	
Is quick to say an evil word.	
Oh God, it was not meant so ill!	        15
Yet pained he turns away who heard.	
 
Oh, love as long as you can love,	
Oh, love as long as love you may!	
The hour will come, the hour will come:	
By graves lamenting you will stay.	        20
 
Then you kneel down before the grave,	
And hide your tearful eyes—alas!	
They see the loved one now no more—	
In long and dewy graveyard grass,	
 
And say: “Look down upon me here	        25
Who by your grave am weeping still;	
Forgive that I have given pain:	
Oh God, it was not meant so ill!”	
 
He sees you not and hears you not,	
And seeks not your embrace—ah, no,	        30
The lips that kissed you oft, no more	
Say: “I forgave you long ago.”	
 
He did forgive you long ago,	
And hot fell many a tear as toll	
For you and for your bitter word—	        35
But hush!—He’s resting at his goal.	
 
Oh, love as long as you can love,	
Oh, love as long as love you may!	
The hour will come, the hour will come:	
By graves lamenting you will stay!	        4
 
IS it to me, this sad lamenting strain?	
Are heaven’s choicest gifts bestowed in vain?	
A plenteous fortune, and a beauteous bride,	
Your love rewarded, gratify’d your pride:	
Yet leaving her—’tis me that you pursue	        5
Without one single charm, but being new.	
How vile is man! how I detest their ways	
Of artful falsehood, and designing praise!	
Tasteless, an easy happiness you slight,	
Ruin your joy, and mischief your delight,	        10
Why should poor pug (the mimic of your kind)	
Wear a rough chain, and be to box confin’d?	
Some cup, perhaps, he breaks, or tears a fan	
While roves unpunish’d the destroyer, man.	
Not bound by vows, and unrestrain’d by shame,	        15
In sport you break the heart, and rend the fame.	
Not that your art can be successful here,	
Th’ already plunder’d need no robber fear:	
Nor sighs, nor charms, nor flatteries can move,	
Too well secur’d against a second love.	        20
Once, and but once, that devil charm’d my mind;	
To reason deaf, to observation blind;	
I idly hop’d (what cannot love persuade?)	
My fondness equal’d, and my love repaid:	
Slow to distrust, and willing to believe,	        25
Long hush’d my doubts, and did myself deceive;	
But oh! too soon—this tale would ever last;	
Sleep, sleep my wrongs, and let me think them past.	
For you, who mourn with counterfeited grief,	
And ask so boldly like a begging thief,	        30
May soon some other nymph inflict the pain,	
You know so well with cruel art to feign.	
Though long you sported with Dan Cupid’s dart,	
You may see eyes, and you may feel a heart.	
So the brisk wits, who stop the evening coach,	        35
Laugh at the fear which follows their approach;	
With idle mirth, and haughty scorn despise	
The passenger’s pale cheek and staring eyes:	
But seiz’d by Justice, find a fright no jest,	
And all the terror doubled in their breast.	        40
 
 
SINCE there’s no help, come let us kiss and part,—	
Nay I have done, you get no more of me;	
And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,	
That thus so cleanly I myself can free;	
Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,	        5
And when we meet at any time again,	
Be it not seen in either of our brows	
That we one jot of former love retain.	
Now at the last gasp of love’s latest breath,	
When his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,	        10
When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,	
And innocence is closing up his eyes,	
  —Now if thou would’st, when all have given him over,	
  From death to life thou might’st him yet decover!	
 

SHALL I compare thee to a summer's day?	 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	 
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;	 
  
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	         5
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	 
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	 
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd.	 
  
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,	 
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;	  10
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,	 
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:—	 
  
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,	 
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.	 
 



LOVE, flooding all the creeks of my dry soul,	
  From which the warm tide ebbed when I was born,	
Following the moon of destiny, doth roll	
  His slow rich wave along the shore forlorn,	
To make the ocean—God—and me, one whole.	        5
 
So, shuddering in its ecstasy, it lies,	
  And, freed from mire and tangle of the ebb,	
Reflects the waxing and the waning skies,	
  And bears upon its panting breast the web	
Of night and her innumerable eyes.	       10
 
Nor can conceive at all that it was blind,	
  But trembling with the sharp approach of love,	
That, strenuous, moves without one breath of wind,	
  Gasps, as the wakening maid, on whom the Dove	
With folded wings of deity declined.	       15
 
She in the virgin sweetness of her dream	
  Thought nothing strange to find her vision true;	
And I thus bathed in living rapture deem	
  No moveless drought my channel ever knew,	
But rustled always with the murmuring stream.	       20
















Look from thy window, and see	
  My passion and my pain!	
I lie on the sands below,	        15
  And I faint in thy disdain.	
Let the night-winds touch thy brow	
  With the heat of my burning sigh,	
And melt thee to hear the vow	
  Of a love that shall not die	        20
    Till the sun grows cold,	
    And the stars are old,	
    And the leaves of the Judgment	
        Book unfold!	
 
My steps are nightly driven,	        25
  By the fever in my breast,	
To hear from thy lattice breathed	
  The word that shall give me rest.	
Open the door of thy heart,	
  And open thy chamber door,	        30
And my kisses shall teach thy lips	
  The love that shall fade no more	
    Till the sun grows cold,	
    And the stars are old,	
    And the leaves of the Judgment	        35
        Book unfold!	
 


  
TILL I have peace with thee, war other men,	
And when I have peace, can I leave thee then?	
All other wars are scrupulous; only thou	
O free 1 fair city, mayst thyself allow	
To any one. In Flanders, who can tell	        5
Whether the master press, or men rebel?	
Only we know, that which most idiots 2 say,	
They must bear blows which come 3 to part the fray.	
France in her lunatic giddiness did hate 4	
Ever our men, yea, and our God, of late;	        10
Yet she relies upon our angels well,	
Which ne’er return, no more than they which fell.	
Sick Ireland is with a strange 5 war possest,	
Like to an ague, now raging, now at rest,	
Which time will cure; yet it must do her good	        15
If she were purg’d, and her head-vein 6 let blood;	
And Midas joys our Spanish journeys give;	
We touch all gold, 7 but find no food to live;	
And I should be in that hot 8 parching clime	
To dust and ashes turned before my time.	        20
To mew me in a ship is to enthral	
Me in a prison that were like to fall;	
Or in a cloister, save that there men dwell	
In a calm heaven, here in a swaying 9 hell.	
Long voyages are long consumptions,	        25
And ships are carts for executions; 10	
Yea, they are deaths; is ’t not all one 11 to fly	
Into another world, as ’tis to die?	
Here let me war; in these arms let me lie:	
Here let me parley, batter, bleed, and die. 12	        30
Thine arms imprison me, and my arms thee;	
Thy heart thy ransom is; take mine for me.	
Other men war, that they their rest may gain,	
But we will rest that we may fight again.	
Those wars th’ ignorant, these th’ experienced love;	        35
There we are always under, here above.	
There 13 engines far off breed a just true fear;	
Near thrusts, pikes, stabs, yea, bullets, hurt not here.	
There lies are wrongs; here safe uprightly lie. 14	
There men kill men; we’ll make one by and by.	        40
Thou nothing, I not half so much shall do 15	
In those wars, 16 as they may which from us two	
Shall spring. Thousands we see which travel not	
To war, but stay, swords, arms, and shot	
To make at home; and shall not I do 17 then	        45
More glorious service, staying to make men?	

WE are in love’s land to-day;	
    Where shall we go?	
Love, shall we start or stay,	
    Or sail or row?	
There ’s many a wind and way,	        5
And never a May but May;	
We are in love’s hand to-day;	
    Where shall we go?	
 
Our landwind is the breath	
Of sorrows kiss’d to death	        10
    And joys that were;	
Our ballast is a rose;	
Our way lies where God knows	
    And love knows where.	
    We are in love’s hand to-day—	        15
 
Our seamen are fledged Loves,	
Our masts are bills of doves,	
    Our decks fine gold;	
Our ropes are dead maids’ hair,	
Our stores are love-shafts fair	        20
    And manifold.	
    We are in love’s land to-day—	
 
Where shall we land you, sweet?	
On fields of strange men’s feet,	
    Or fields near home?	        25
Or where the fire-flowers blow,	
Or where the flowers of snow	
    Or flowers of foam?	
    We are in love’s hand to-day—	
 
Land me, she says, where love	        30
Shows but one shaft, one dove,	
    One heart, one hand,—	
A shore like that, my dear,	
Lies where no man will steer,	
    No maiden land.	        35
 


THAT Love is all there is,	
Is all we know of Love;	
It is enough, the freight should be	
Proportioned to the groove.	


 
FAREWELL, Love, and all thy laws for ever;	
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more:	
Senec, and Plato, call me from thy lore,	
To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour;	
In blind error when I did persever,	        5
Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,	
Taught me in trifles that I set no store;	
But scaped forth thence, since, liberty is lever:	
Therefore, farewell, go trouble younger hearts,	
And in me claim no more authority:	        10
With idle youth go use thy property,	
And thereon spend thy many brittle darts:	
  For, hitherto though I have lost my time,	
  Me list no longer rotten boughs to clime.	
 


From the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” Canto III.
OF him I love day and night, I dream’d I heard he was dead;	 
And I dream’d I went where they had buried him I love—but he was not in that place;	 
And I dream’d I wander’d, searching among burial-places, to find him;	 
And I found that every place was a burial-place;	 
The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now;)	         5
The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,	 
And fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living;	 
—And what I dream’d I will henceforth tell to every person and age,	 
And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream’d;	 
And now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with them;	  10
And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied;	 
And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly render’d to powder, and pour’d in the sea, I shall be satisfied;	 
Or if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be satisfied.	 

AND said I that my limbs were old,	
And said I that my blood was cold,	
And that my kindly fire was fled,	
And my poor withered heart was dead,	
  And that I might not sing of love?—	        5
How could I, to the dearest theme	
That ever warmed a minstrel’s dream,	
  So foul, so false a recreant prove!	
How could I name love’s very name,	
Nor wake my heart to notes of flame!	        10
 
In peace, Love tunes the shepherd’s reed;	
In war, he mounts the warrior’s steed;	
In halls, in gay attire is seen;	
In hamlets, dances on the green.	
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,	        15
And men below, and saints above;	
For love is heaven, and heaven is love.	
 
True love’s the gift which God has given	
To man alone beneath the heaven;	
  It is not fantasy’s hot fire,	        20
    Whose wishes, soon as granted, fly;	
  It liveth not in fierce desire,	
    With dead desire it doth not die;	
It is the secret sympathy,	
The silver link, the silken tie,	        25
Which heart to heart, and mind to mind,	
In body and in soul can bind.
Meli.  Yet what is love, good shepherd, sain?	
Fau.  It is a sunshine mixed with rain;	
It is a tooth-ache, or like pain;	        15
It is a game where none doth gain;	
  The lass saith no, and would full fain;	
  And this is love, as I hear sain.	
 
Meli.  Yet, shepherd, what is love, I pray?	
Fau.  It is a yea, it is a nay,	        20
A pretty kind of sporting fray;	
It is a thing will soon away;	
  Then, nymphs, take ’vantage while ye may;	
  And this is love, as I hear say.	
 
Meli.  Yet what is love, good shepherd, show?	        25
Fau.  A thing that creeps; it cannot go;	
A prize that passeth to and fro;	
A thing for one, a thing for moe;	
  And he that proves shall find it so;	
  And, shepherd, this is love, I trow.
[S. W. R.] IGNOTO.

And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,	 
An undistinguishable throng,	 
And gentle wishes long subdued,	  75
    Subdued and cherish'd long!	 
 
She wept with pity and delight,	 
She blush'd with love and virgin shame;	 
And like the murmur of a dream,	 
    I heard her breathe my name.	  80
 
Her bosom heaved—she stepp'd aside,	 
As conscious of my look she stept—	 
Then suddenly, with timorous eye	 
    She fled to me and wept.	 
 
She half enclosed me with her arms,	  85
She press'd me with a meek embrace;	 
And bending back her head, look'd up,	 
    And gazed upon my face.	 
 
'Twas partly love, and partly fear,	 
And partly 'twas a bashful art,	  90
That I might rather feel, than see.	 
    The swelling of her heart.	 
 
I calm'd her fears, and she was calm,	 
And told her love with virgin pride;	 
And so I won my Genevieve,	  95
    My bright and beauteous Bride.	 


IT was an English ladye bright,	
  The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,	
And she would marry a Scottish knight,	
  For Love will still be lord of all.	
 
Blithely they saw the rising sun,	        5
  When he shone fair on Carlisle wall,	
But they were sad ere day was done,	
  Though Love was still the lord of all.	
 
Her sire gave brooch and jewel fine,	
  Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall;	        10
Her brother gave but a flask of wine,	
  For ire that Love was lord of all.	
 
For she had lands, both meadow and lea,	
  Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,	
And he swore her death, ere he would see	        15
  A Scottish knight the lord of all.	
 
That wine she had not tasted well,	
  The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,	
When dead in her true love’s arms she fell,	
  For Love was still the lord of all.	        20
 
He pierced her brother to the heart,	
  Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall:—	
So perish all would true love part,	
  That Love may still be lord of all!	
 
And then he took the cross divine,	        25
  Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,	
And died for her sake in Palestine;	
  So Love was still the lord of all.	
 
Now all ye lovers, that faithful prove,	
  The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,	        30
Pray for their souls who died for love,	
  For Love shall still be lord of all!
 
I MET the Love-Talker one eve in the glen,	
He was handsomer than any of our handsome young men,	
His eyes were blacker than the sloe, his voice sweeter far	
Than the crooning of old Kevin’s pipes beyond in Coolnagar.	
 
I was bound for the milking with a heart fair and free—	        5
My grief! my grief! that bitter hour drained the life from me;	
I thought him human lover, though his lips on mine were cold,	
And the breath of death blew keen on me within his hold.	
 
I know not what way he came, no shadow fell behind,	
But all the sighing rushes swayed beneath a faery wind	        10
The thrush ceased its singing, a mist crept about,	
We two clung together—with the world shut out.	
 
Beyond the ghostly mist I could hear my cattle low,	
The little cow from Ballina, clean as driven snow,	
The dun cow from Kerry, the roan from Inisheer,	        15
Oh, pitiful their calling—and his whispers in my ear!	
 
His eyes were a fire; his words were a snare;	
I cried my mother’s name, but no help was there;	
I made the blessed Sign; then he gave a dreary moan,	
A wisp of cloud went floating by, and I stood alone.	        20
 
Running ever through my head, is an old-time rune—	
“Who meets the Love-Talker must weave her shroud soon.”	
My mother’s face is furrowed with the salt tears that fall,	
But the kind eyes of my father are the saddest sight of all.	
 
I have spun the fleecy lint, and now my wheel is still,	        25
The linen length is woven for my shroud fine and chill,	
I shall stretch me on the bed where a happy maid I lay—	
Pray for the soul of Mairé Og at dawning of the day!	
 

  Yea, here the end	
Of love’s astonishment! Now know we Spirit,	
And Who, for ease of joy, contriveth Spirit.	
Now all life’s loveliness and power we have	      110
Dissolved in this one moment, and our burning	
Carries all shining upward, till in us	
Life is not life, but the desire of God,	
Himself desiring and himself accepting.	
Now what was prophecy in us is made	      115
Fulfilment: we are the hour and we are the joy,	
We in our marvellousness of single knowledge,	
Of Spirit breaking down the room of fate	
And drawing into his light the greeting fire	
Of God,—God known in ecstasy of love	      120
Wedding himself to utterance of himself.
Yet what is Love, good shepherd sain?	
It is a sunshine mixed with rain,	
It is a toothache or like pain,	        15
It is a game where none hath gain;	
The lass saith no, yet would full fain:	
And this is Love, as I hear sain. 3	
 
Yet, shepherd, what is Love, I pray?	
It is a yes, it is a nay,	        20
A pretty kind of sporting fray,	
It is a thing will soon away.	
Then, nymphs, take vantage while ye may:	
And this is Love, as I hear say.	
 
Yet what is Love, good shepherd, show?	        25
A thing that creeps, it cannot go,	
A prize that passeth to and fro,	
A thing for one, a thing for moe,	
And he that proves shall find it so;	
And, shepherd, this is Love, I trow.	        30

O hearken the words of his voice of compassion:	
  ‘Come cling round about me, ye faithful who sicken	
Of the weary unrest and the world’s passing fashion!	
  As the rain in mid-morning your troubles shall thicken,	        25
  But surely within you some Godhead doth quicken,	
As ye cry to me heeding and leading you home.	
 
‘Come—pain ye shall have, and be blind to the ending!	
  Come—fear ye shall have, mid the sky’s overcasting!	
Come—change ye shall have, for far are ye wending!	        30
  Come—no crown ye shall have for your thirst and your fasting,	
  But the kiss’d lips of Love and fair life everlasting!	
Cry out, for one heedeth, who leadeth you home!’	
 
Is he gone? was he with us?—ho ye who seek saving,	
  Go no further; come hither! for have we not found it?	        35
Here is the House of Fulfilment of Craving;	
  Here is the Cup with the roses around it;	
  The World’s wound well healed, and the balm that hath bound it:	
Cry out! for he heedeth, fair Love that led home.
Tho’ the bard to purer fame may soar,	
        When wild youth’s past;	
Tho’ he win the wise, who frown’d before,	
        To smile at last;	        15
        He’ll never meet	
        A joy so sweet,	
    In all his noon of fame,	
As when first he sung to woman’s ear,	
    His soul-felt flame,	        20
And, at every close, she blush’d to hear	
    The one loved name.	
  
BEHOLD, Love, thy power how she despiseth;	
My grievous pain how little she regardeth:	
The solemn oath, whereof she takes no cure,	
Broken she hath, and yet, she bideth sure,	
Right at her ease, and little thee she dreadeth:	        5
  Weaponed thou art, and she unarmed sitteth:	
To thee disdainful, all her life she leadeth;	
To me spiteful, without just cause or measure:	
Behold, Love, how proudly she triumpheth.	
  I am in hold, but if thee pity moveth,	        10
Go, bend thy bow, that stony hearts breaketh,	
And with some stroke revenge the displeasure	
Of thee, and him that sorrow doth endure,	
And, as his lord, thee lowly here entreateth.	
 

No,—that hallowed form is ne’er forgot	
        Which first love traced;	
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot	        25
        On memory’s waste.	
        ’Twas odour fled	
        As soon as shed;	
    ’Twas morning’s wingèd dream;	
’Twas a light that ne’er can shine again	        30
    On life’s dull stream:	
Oh! ’twas light that ne’er can shine again	
    On life’s dull stream.
If my Love knew I could wash and wring,	
If my Love knew I could weave and spin,	
I would make a dress all of the finest kind,	
But the want of money, sure, leaves me behind.	        20
 
And still she cried, “I love him the best,	
And a troubled mind, sure, can know no rest,”	
And still she cried, “Bonny boys are few,	
And if my Love leaves me, what will I do?”	
 
I know my Love is an arrant rover,	        25
I know he’ll wander the wide world over,	
In dear old Ireland he’ll no longer tarry,	
And an English one he is sure to marry.	
And still she cried, “I love him the best,	
And a troubled mind, sure, can know no rest,”	        30
And still she cried, “Bonny boys are few,	
And if my Love leaves me, what will I do?”























There with thy daughter Pleasure they doe play	
Their hurtlesse sports, without rebuke or blame,	
And in her snowy bosome boldly lay	
Their quiet heads, devoyd of guilty shame,	        290
After full joyance of their gentle game;	
Then her they crowne their goddesse and their queene,	
And decke with floures thy altars well beseene.	
 
Ay me! deare lord, that ever I might hope,	
For all the paines and woes that I endure,	        295
To come at length unto the wished scope	
Of my desire, or might my selfe assure,	
That happie port for ever to recure!	
Then would I thinke these paines no paines at all,	
And all my woes to be but penance small.	        300
 
Then would I sing of thine immortall praise	
An heavenly hymne, such as the angels sing,	
And thy triumphant name then would I raise	
Bove all the gods, thee onely honoring,	
My guide, my god, my victor, and my king:	        305
Till then, dread lord, vouchsafe to take of me	
This simple song, thus fram’d in praise of thee.
(From The Giaour)

THE COLD in clime are cold in blood,	
  Their love can scarce deserve the name;	
But mine was like the lava flood	
  That boils in Ætna’s breast of flame.	
I cannot prate in puling strain	        5
Of ladye-love, and beauty’s chain:	
If changing cheek, and scorching vein,	
Lips taught to writhe, but not complain,	
If bursting heart, and madd’ning brain,	
And daring deed, and vengeful steel,	        10
And all that I have felt, and feel,	
Betoken love—that love was mine,	
And shown by many a bitter sign.	
’Tis true, I could not whine nor sigh,	
I knew but to obtain or die.	        15
I die—but first I have possess’d,	
And come what may, I have been blest.	
Shall I the doom I sought upbraid?	
No—reft of all, yet undismay’d	
But for the thought of Leila slain,	        20
Give me the pleasure with the pain,	
So would I live and love again.	
I grieve, but not, my holy guide!	
For him who dies, but her who died:	
She sleeps beneath the wandering wave—	        25
Ah! had she but an earthly grave,	
This breaking heart and throbbing head	
Should seek and share her narrow bed.	
She was a form of life and light,	
That, seen, became a part of sight;	        30
And rose, where’er I turn’d mine eye,	
The Morning-star of Memory!	
You grew a matron plump and comely,	 
  You dwelt in fashion's brightest blaze;	 
My earthly lot was far more homely;	  35
  But I too had my festal days.	 
No merrier eyes have ever glisten'd	 
  Around the hearth-stone's wintry glow,	 
Than when my youngest child was christen'd;	 
  But that was twenty years ago.	  40
 
Time pass'd. My eldest girl was married,	 
  And I am now a grandsire gray;	 
One pet of four years old I've carried	 
  Among the wild-flower'd meads to play.	 
In our old fields of childish pleasure,	  45
  Where now, as then, the cowslips blow,	 
She fills her basket's ample measure;	 
  And that is not ten years ago.	 
 
But though first love's impassion'd blindness	 
  Has pass'd away in colder light,	  50
I still have thought of you with kindness,	 
  And shall do, till our last good-night.	 
The ever-rolling silent hours	 
  Will bring a time we shall not know,	 
When our young days of gathering flowers	  55
  Will be an hundred years ago.

With sence whereof whilest so thy softened spirit	
Is inly toucht, and humbled with meeke zeale,	
Through meditation of his endlesse merit,	        255
Lift up thy mind to th’ author of thy weale,	
And to his soveraine mercie doe appeale;	
Learne him to love, that loved thee so deare,	
And in thy brest his blessed image beare.	
 
With all thy hart, with all thy soule and mind,	        260
Thou must him love, and his beheasts embrace;	
All other loves, with which the world doth blind	
Weake fancies, and stirre up affections base,	
Thou must renounce, and utterly displace,	
And give thy selfe unto him full and free,	        265
That full and freely gave himselfe to thee.	
 
Then shalt thou feele thy spirit so possest,	
And ravisht with devouring great desire	
Of his deare selfe, that shall thy feeble brest	
Inflame with love, and set thee all on fire	        270
With burning zeale, through every part entire,	
That in no earthly thing thou shalt delight,	
But in his sweet and amiable sight.	
 
Thenceforth all worlds desire will in thee dye,	
And all earthes glorie, on which men do gaze,	        275
Seeme durt and drosse in thy pure sighted eye,	
Compar’d to that celestiall beauties blaze,	
Whose glorious beames all fleshly sense doth daze	
With admiration of their passing light,	
Blinding the eyes and lumining the spright.	        280
 
Then shall thy ravisht soule inspired bee	
With heavenly thoughts, farre above humane skil,	
And thy bright radiant eyes shall plainely see	
Th’ idee of his pure glorie present still	
Before thy face, that all thy spirits shall fill	        285
With sweete enragement of celestiall love,	
Kindled through sight of those faire things above.
    His Ganymede! His life! His joy!	
Or He comes down to me, or takes me up	
    That I might be His boy,	
And fill, and taste, and give, and drink the cup,	
    But those (tho’ great) are all	       35
      Too short and small,	
Too weak and feeble pictures to express	
The true mysterious depths of Blessedness.	
  I am His image, and His friend,	
  His son, bride, glory, temple, end.	       40
“Good Mussulman, abstain from pork.	
There is a part in every swine	
No friend or follower of mine	
May taste, whate’er his inclination,	        5
On pain of excommunication.”	
Such Mohammed’s mysterious charge,	
And thus he left the point at large.	
Had he the sinful part expressed,	
They might with safety eat the rest;	        10
But for one piece they thought it hard	
From the whole hog to be debarred,	
And set their wit at work to find	
What joint the Prophet had in mind.	
Much controversy straight arose—	        15
These chose the back, the belly those;	
By some, ’tis confidently said,	
He meant not to forbid the head;	
While others at that doctrine rail,	
And piously prefer the tail.	        20
Thus, conscience freed from every clog,	
Mohammedans eat up the hog.	
  You laugh—’tis well. The tale applied	
May make you laugh on t’other side.	
Renounce the world! the preacher cries.	        25
We do! a multitude replies.	
While one as innocent regards	
A snug and friendly game at cards;	
And one, whatever you may say,	
Can see no evil in a play;	        30
Some love a concert, or a race;	
And others shooting, and the chase.	
Reviled and loved, renounced and followed,	
Thus, bit by bit, the world is swallowed;	
Each thinks his neighbour makes too free,	        35
Yet likes a slice as well as he.	
With sophistry their sauce they sweeten,	
Till quite from tail to snout ’tis eaten.















What lurks in the deep gaze	
Of the old wolf? Amaze,	
Hope, recognition, gladness, anger, fear.	      105
But deeper than all these	
Love muses, yearns, and sees,	
And is the self that does not change nor veer.	
 LOVE bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,	 
                Guiltie of dust and sinne.	 
But quick-ey'd Love, observing me grow slack	 
                From my first entrance in,	 
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,	         5
                If I lack'd any thing.	 
  
A guest, I answer'd, worthy to be here:	 
                Love said, you shall be he.	 
I the unkinde, ungratefull? Ah my deare,	 
                I cannot look on thee.	  10
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,	 
                Who made the eyes but I?	 
  
Truth Lord, but I have marr'd them: let my shame	 
                Go where it doth deserve.	 
And know you not, sayes Love, who bore the blame?	  15
                My deare, then I will serve.	 
You must sit down, sayes Love, and taste my meat:	 
                So I did sit and eat.	 
 

Not love of self alone,	
Struggle for lair and bone,	      110
But self-denying love of mate and young,	
Love that is kind and wise,	
Knows trust and sacrifice,	
And croons the old dark universal tongue.…	
  
ALONE upon the housetops to the North	
I turn and watch the lightning in the sky—	
The glamour of thy footsteps in the North.	
Come back to me, Beloved, or I die.	
 
Below my feet the still bazar is laid—	        5
Far, far below the weary camels lie—	
The camels and the captives of thy raid.	
Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!	
 
My father’s wife is old and harsh with years	
And drudge of all my father’s house am I—	        10
My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears.	
Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!	
 
And who has understood	      115
Our brothers of the wood,	
Save he who puts off guile and every guise	
Of violence,—made truce	
With panther, bear, and moose,	
As beings like ourselves whom love makes wise?	      120
 
For they, too, do love’s will,	
Our lesser clansmen still;	
The House of Many Mansions holds us all;	
Courageous, glad and hale,	
They go forth on the trail,	      125
Hearing the message, hearkening to the call.…	
 
Open the door to-night	
Within your heart, and light	
The lantern of love there to shine afar.	
On a tumultuous sea	      130
Some straining craft, maybe,	
With bearings lost, shall sight love’s silver star.	
WHEN the lamp is shatter'd	 
The light in the dust lies dead—	 
When the cloud is scatter'd,	 
The rainbow's glory is shed.	 
When the lute is broken,	         5
Sweet tones are remember'd not;	 
When the lips have spoken,	 
Lov'd accents are soon forgot.	 
  
As music and splendour	 
Survive not the lamp and the lute,	  10
The heart's echoes render	 
No song when the spirit is mute—	 
No song but sad dirges,	 
Like the wind through a ruin'd cell,	 
Or the mournful surges	  15
That ring the dead seaman's knell.	 
  
When hearts have once mingl'd,	 
Love first leaves the well-built nest;	 
The weak one is singl'd	 
To endure what it once possesst.	  20
O Love! who bewailest	 
The frailty of all things here,	 
Why choose you the frailest	 
For your cradle, your home, and your bier?	 
  
Its passions will rock thee	  25
As the storms rock the ravens on high;	 
Bright reason will mock thee	 
Like the sun from a wintry sky.	 
From thy nest every rafter	 
Will rot, and thine eagle home	  30
Leave thee naked to laughter,	 
When leaves fall and cold winds come.	 
 

ALL June I bound the rose in sheaves.	
Now, rose by rose, I strip the leaves	
And strow them where Pauline may pass.	
She will not turn aside? Alas!	
Let them lie. Suppose they die?	        5
The chance was they might take her eye.	
 
How many a month I strove to suit	
These stubborn fingers to the lute!	
To-day I venture all I know.	
She will not hear my music? So!	        10
Break the string; fold music’s wing:	
Suppose Pauline had bade me sing!	
 
My whole life long I learn’d to love.	
This hour my utmost art I prove	
And speak my passion—heaven or hell?	        15
She will not give me heaven? ’T is well!	
Lose who may—I still can say,	
Those who win heaven, bless’d are they!	
I WILL row my boat on Muckross Lake when the grey of the dove	
Comes down at the end of the day; and a quiet like prayer	
Grows soft in your eyes, and among your fluttering hair	
The red of the sun is mixed with the red of your cheek.	
I will row you, O boat of my heart! till our mouths have forgotten to speak	        5
In the silence of love, broken only by trout that spring	
And are gone, like a fairy’s finger that casts a ring	
With the luck of the world for the hand that can hold it fast.	
I will rest on my oars, my eyes on your eyes, till our thoughts have passed	
From the lake and the sky and the rings of the jumping fish;	        10
Till our ears are filled from the reeds with a sudden swish,	
And a sound like the beating of flails in the time of corn.	
We shall hold our breath while a wonderful thing is born	
From the songs that were chanted by bards in the days gone by;	
For a wild white swan shall be leaving the lake for the sky,	        15
With the curve of her neck stretched out in a silver spear.	
Oh! then when the creak of her wings shall have brought her near,	
We shall hear again a swish, and a beating of flails,	
And a creaking of oars, and a sound like the wind in sails,	
As the mate of her heart shall follow her into the air.	        20
O wings of my soul! we shall think of Angus and Caer,	
And Etain and Midir, that were changed into wild white swans	
To fly round the ring of the heavens, through the dusks and the dawns,	
Unseen by all but true lovers, till judgment day,	
Because they had loved for love only. O love! I will say,	        25
For a woman and man with eternity ringing them round,	
And the heavens above and below them, a poor thing it is to be bound	
To four low walls that will spill like a pedlar’s pack,	
And a quilt that will run into holes, and a churn that will dry and crack.	
Oh! better than these, a dream in the night, or our heart’s mute prayer	        30
That O’Donoghue, the enchanted man, should pass between water and air,	
And say, I will change them each to a wild white swan,	
Like the lovers Angus and Midir, and their loved ones, Caer and Etain,	
Because they have loved for love only, and have searched through the shadows of things	
For the Heart of all hearts, through the fire of love, and the wine of love, and the wings.	
Then shalt thou feele thy spirit so possest	
And ravisht with devouring great desire	
Of His dear selfe, that shall thy feeble brest	
Inflame with love, and set thee all on fire	        270
With burning zeale, through every part entire,	
That in no earthly thing thou shalt delight,	
But in His sweet and amiable sight.	
 
Thenceforth all world’s desire will in thee dye;	
And all earthe’s glorie, on which men do gaze,	        275
Seeme durt and drosse in thy pure-sighted eye,	
Compar’d to that celestiall beautie’s blaze,	
Whose glorious beames all fleshly sense doth daze	
With admiration of their passing light,	
Blinding the eyes, and lumining the spright.	        280
 
Then shall thy ravisht soul inspired bee	
With heavenly thoughts, farre above humane skil,	
And thy bright radiant eyes shall plainely see	
Th’ idee of His pure glorie present still	
Before thy face, that all thy spirits shall fill	        285
With sweete enragement of celestiall love,	
Kindled through sight of those faire things above.
‘Till I turn from Female love	
And root up the Infernal Grove,	
I shall never worthy be	       55
To step into Eternity.	
 
‘And, to end thy cruel mocks,	
Annihilate thee on the rocks,	
And another form create	
To be subservient to my fate.	       60
 
‘Let us agree to give up love,	
And root up the Infernal Grove;	
Then shall we return and see	
The worlds of happy Eternity.	
 
‘And throughout all Eternity	       65
I forgive you, you forgive me.	
As our dear Redeemer said:	
“This the Wine, and this the Bread.”’	

ELYSIUM is as far as to	
The very nearest room,	
If in that room a friend await	
Felicity or doom.	
  
What fortitude the soul contains,	        5
That it can so endure	
The accent of a coming foot,	
The opening of a door!	
ALTER? When the hills do.	
Falter? When the sun	
Question if his glory	
Be the perfect one.	
Surfeit? When the daffodil	        5
Doth of the dew:	
Even as herself, O friend!	
I will of you!	

YOU left me, sweet, two legacies,—	
A legacy of love	
A Heavenly Father would content,	
Had He the offer of;	
  
You left me boundaries of pain	        5
Capacious as the sea,	
Between eternity and time,	
Your consciousness and me.	


MINE by the right of the white election!	
Mine by the royal seal!	
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison	
Bars cannot conceal!	
  
Mine, here in vision and in veto!	        5
Mine, by the grave’s repeal	
Titled, confirmed,—delirious charter!	
Mine, while the ages steal!
