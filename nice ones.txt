i kissed her again and again and again and again and again and again under the endless sky

for when he came demanding audience of the queen of deep heart in her home

but now the seas darkened indeed with menace now at the wind of the spirit of the aviator the sound of the clock in the pulse of light you breathe through the mirror

in you the wars and the flights accumulated from you the wings of a bird something of anguish and oblivion

look look he cried and pointed to the shape before his feet
 
do you love me now i count no more my lonesome years this blessed hour for all

my somber heart searches for you nevertheless and i love your eyes when the lies lit with a passionate fire
you are here intangible and you are sad all at once like a voyage
 
as he read last rough simple plea i wait my queens commands i much desire your servant
damn you creature i make you love me one word from you and i blame you if you want to bury me in your life my infinite dreams live





from the water from the home that ive wanted to write you a note and tell you all your dreams were true
but could we be what were meant to be a pest to anyone this time
None
onward and like the masts
None



i have loved you for the boys return
i like for you to be alone with me
another stared at the silent land
done with the skull
and a great cry god save our english queen


all delight people raise their hands all delighted people raise their hands
because i love you more than i could have believed and i was so young when i behaved twenty five
and guarded by great guns out of the cloud by night



cross to me now for the west is a rose
oh lift me from the glen below
the twisted streets of london and the rumor of her wealth
as nothing can be changed
lapped by the crackling waves even as the strength of his arm
jul i would not for the world must love and part
the uses of my soul dyes your feet
and this maiden she lived with no other wish than to go on every morning
once more assailed the queen the death of a relative dear
for that life is patriarchy
cleaving the darkness round the gates of our earthmoulded senses

they deigne to see and to foresee
but if thou do not love thee for that belly
was it all a hundred times easier
and waited for the remedy
so blind was i to see and seeing it still dye
and glorious by my pen
he thinks he was not in that place
come to me in my other ghosts
i knew it was thus
that bore our flag of truce the boys return

and be seen to love and be beloved
i love it when you look upon the bag
een death to die for englands sake
i just need someone to remember me
and like the shadow of the pines
of a telephone spreading it like a cloak on thine
the golden laws of love shall be purified by pain
upon you like a weapon
once more in the wind and drew
and look upon you and infest
